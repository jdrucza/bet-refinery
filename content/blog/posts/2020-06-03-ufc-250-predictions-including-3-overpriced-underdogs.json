Originally scheduled for Nunes' Brazil, the fight takes place in front of a limited audience in Las Vegas.\n\nI know you guys want the mail for the Main Card, and we'll share a Nunes vs Spencer prediction at the bottom. However, the biggest value bets are in the early prelims and then the preliminary card. \n\n\n\n\n\n## **Devin Clark vs Alonzo Menifield**\n\nLight Heavyweight is a bizarre decision. There aren’t many guys who I’d consider fundamentally sound all-rounders, and Clark is one of the few. He’s also got a tendency of being finished in hilarious fashion after gassing a bit by fighters who are less-sound than him but nonetheless have moments of pure athlete that override his technical dominance.\n\nSo the question must be asked. Why am I choosing to once-again sacrifice my money on the altar of Devin Clark? I know in the depths of my soul that Clark will win the first however-many minutes with ease, grace, panache, and style before inevitably slowing down a bit and getting made into hay.\n\nBut, nonetheless, I feel that Clark at 2.7 is in no way justified at this point. Menifield’s crushed Vinicius Moreira, who seems like a lovely guy, but nonetheless isn’t really capable of hanging in the UFC. He KO’d Craig, but it was a bit of a bizarre turn of events in which Craig was actually proficiently out striking him before toppling over on a missed spin kick and getting pounced upon.\n\nI don’t really think Menifield has many strings to his bow. He’s a good athlete, definitely. But an almost-complete void of process at this point. Clark has a great chance of grounding him for long stretches, and should also be considerably busier standing.\n\nMenifield’s win condition is probably a singular moment of violence, which is definitely live, but I can’t mark his lack of process with enough seriousness that I think he warrants his current 1.45~ price point.\n\n## Prediction\n\nDevin Clark by decision\n\n## **Betting Strategy**\n\nBacking Clark to Win for 1 unit at $2.70\n\n\n\n### Evan Dunham vs Herbert Burns\n\nAnother battle of process vs durability, though Dunham’s also got the burden of age on top of it all. I don’t especially rate Burns’ ability in any phase.\n\nHe’s a capable grappler in terms of career achievements, but way too guard-reliant to have it as a core skillset in the UFC, along with Dunham being capable of stifling in that phase. And he’s not great on the feet by any means. There’s very little defensive process, along with a striking game that usually seems to consist of hail marys.\n\nEvan Dunham retired recently but was planning this comeback before Coronavirus which is at least a partly-promising sign. He should have size on Burns, and I believe he’s generally the sounder fighter as a whole.\n\nThe main issue is that he has a glowing weak point when it comes to body shots. Another fight that my pick will likely be winning the minutes in until he gets slain in a singular moment of violence, but sometimes you just have to bet the process.\n\n## Prediction\n\nDunham by Decision\n\n## Betting Strategy\n\nBack Dunham to Win for 2 units at $3.20\n\n\n\n## **Sean O'Malley vs Eddie Wineland**\n\nThis should largely be a striking match, and as such, I don’t think there’s much of a coherent way that you can support Malley being such a gigantic favorite. Eddie Wineland’s generally been a tough out in the UFC over the course of a long career and has rarely if ever been completely outgunned in striking contests.\n\nWhilst it’s true that Malley’s fresh on the block, exciting and all of those other vibes… I just can’t see how you make a coherent argument for him being this big a favorite when he’s got defensive holes, some previous cardio lapses, and Wineland is historically such a steady bastion pf the Bantamweight division.\n\nEven factoring in the age-gap, I just can’t see how anybody plays Malley past 1.6. He’s a volatile, high-variance striker at the best of times and has shown some issues with defense at the UFC level.\n\nWineland hits very hard so far as boxing’s concerned, this should generally be a close bout in a lot of respects. I’ve got an annoying feeling that Wineland puts up a brave performance in a razor-thin loss, but I just generally cannot see how anybody justifies this pricing for Malley here.\n\n## Prediction\n\nClose decision\n\n## Betting Strategy\n\nBacking Wineland to Win for 2 units at $5.00",
