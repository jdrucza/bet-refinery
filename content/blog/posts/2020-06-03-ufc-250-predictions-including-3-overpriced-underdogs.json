Originally scheduled for Nunes' Brazil, the fight takes place in front of a limited audience in Las Vegas.\n\nWe know you guys want a detailed preview of the full card but, as usual, Gugabe's UFC 250 predictions skew towards value. Specifically, which fighters does Gugabe think are over the odds with sportsbooks. Which fighters have a better probability of winning than the odds suggest.\n\nSo without further ado, lets get into his favourite UFC 250 predictions. Starting with the early prelims and going up to the main event.\n\n\n\n- - -\n\n## **Devin Clark vs Alonzo Menifield**\n\nLight Heavyweight is a bizarre decision. There aren’t many guys who I’d consider fundamentally sound all-rounders, and Clark is one of the few. He’s also got a tendency of being finished in hilarious fashion after gassing a bit by fighters who are less-sound than him. Nonetheless, he has moments of pure athleticism that overrides his technical dominance.\n\nSo the question must be asked. Why am I choosing to once-again sacrifice my money on the altar of Devin Clark? I know in the depths of my soul that Clark will win the first however-many minutes with ease, grace, panache, and style before inevitably slowing down a bit and getting made into hay.\n\nBut, nonetheless, I feel that Clark at +170 is in no way justified at this point. Menifield’s crushed Vinicius Moreira, who seems like a lovely guy, but isn’t really capable of hanging in the UFC. He KO’d Craig, but it was a bit of a bizarre turn of events in which Craig was out striking him before toppling over on a missed spin kick and getting pounced upon.\n\nI don’t really think Menifield has many strings to his bow. He’s a good athlete, definitely. But an almost-complete void of process at this point. Clark has a great chance of grounding him for long stretches, and should also be considerably busier standing.\n\nMenifield’s win condition is probably a singular moment of violence, which is definitely live, but he's way too short with the sportsbooks. Clark at the odds.\n\n### **UFC 250 Prediction**\n\nDevin Clark by decision\n\n### **Betting Strategy**\n\n**Backing Clark to Win for 1 unit at +196 with Fanduel**\n\n\n- - -\n\n## Evan Dunham vs Herbert Burns\n\nAnother battle of process vs durability, though Dunham’s also got the burden of age on top of it all. I don’t especially rate Burns’ ability in any phase.\n\nHe’s a capable grappler in terms of career achievements, but way too guard-reliant to have it as a core skillset in the UFC, along with Dunham being capable of stifling in that phase. And he’s not great on the feet by any means. There’s very little defensive process, along with a striking game that usually seems to consist of hail marys.\n\nEvan Dunham retired recently but was planning this comeback before Coronavirus which is at least a partly-promising sign. He should have size on Burns, and I believe he’s generally the sounder fighter as a whole.\n\nThe main issue is that he has a glowing weak point when it comes to body shots. Another fight that my pick will likely be winning the minutes in until he gets slain in a singular moment of violence, but sometimes you just have to bet the process.\n\n### **UFC 250 Predictions**\n\nDunham by Decision\n\n### Betting Strategy\n\nBack Dunham to Win for 2 units at +310 with Fanduel\n\n\n- - -\n\n## **Sean O'Malley vs Eddie Wineland**\n\nThis should largely be a striking match, and as such, I don’t think there’s much of a coherent way that you can support Malley being such a gigantic favorite. Eddie Wineland’s generally been a tough out in the UFC over the course of a long career and has rarely if ever been completely outgunned in striking contests.\n\nWhilst it’s true that Malley’s fresh on the block, exciting and all of those other vibes… I just can’t see how you make a coherent argument for him being this big a favorite when he’s got defensive holes, some previous cardio lapses, and Wineland is historically such a steady bastion pf the Bantamweight division.\n\nEven factoring in the age-gap, I just can’t see how anybody plays Malley past 1.6. He’s a volatile, high-variance striker at the best of times and has shown some issues with defense at the UFC level.\n\nWineland hits very hard so far as boxing’s concerned, this should generally be a close bout in a lot of respects. I’ve got an annoying feeling that Wineland puts up a brave performance in a razor-thin loss, but I just generally cannot see how anybody justifies this pricing for Malley here.\n\n### **UFC 250 Prediction**\n\nClose decision\n\n### Betting Strategy\n\nBacking Wineland to Win for 2 units at +380 with Bet365\n\n\n- - -\n\n## Amanda Nunes vs Felicia Spencer\n\nThis card’s a little odd in that the title fight’s probably overshadowed in terms of divisional relevance, general interest and the rest by other parts of the card, but it should be a solid showcase for Amanda Nunes’ skillset. Felicia Spencer is otherworldly tough, having taken a complete shellacking at the hands of Cris Cyborg in their contest last year, but I feel that the initial first 5 minute burst of Amanda Nunes is unparalleled in WMMA history when it comes to finishing ability. Cyborg learned that first hand in her contest with Nunes, one that I feel Cyborg probably walks with surprising ease if she hadn’t decided to get into the proverbial ego-driven swinging match to start the bout.\n\nSo the question of this fight, in my eyes, will be one of Nunes’ tempo. I feel that Nunes has historically shown a tendency to either go completely ballistic in the first round, or set a relatively relaxed pace. This is due to her history of issues with her gastank, even in her recent bout against Germaine De Randamie there was a notable cardio drop off as she moved into later rounds. Spencer is gritty, tough and has no functional striking defense. Her win condition is most likely the old ‘Boxcar Homer’ approach, in which she elects to exist in Nunes’ direction till Nunes gets tired. Unfortunately for Spencer, I don’t think that she’s going to be able to absorb the punishment that’s going to be coming her way in response to the approach. But it is possible that she weathers the storm and wins on pure aggression against a visibly-fading Nunes.\n\n### **UFC 250 Prediction**\n\nNunes via Round 1 Brutality.\n\n### Betting Strategy\n\n 2 units on Amanda Nunes Round 1 +225 with Sugarhouse",
