  "body": "Are you looking for **Biden VP Odds**? \n\nYou know that Kamala Harris is the raging favorite from an all female cast of possible **Democratic Vice Presidential Candidates**. But how likely is Harris?\n\nHer odds are fluctuating every day. From between 30-60% in the last few weeks. \n\nShe's a strong favorite but she's not home yet.\n\nWhat are Harris' odds at this point in time, and who are her closest challengers?\n\n- - -\n\n## **2020 Biden VP Odds**\n\n<canvas id='g11' name=\"brgraph\" data-file-name=\"DemocraticVPOdds.json\" data-only-names=\"Kamala Harris,Susan Rice,Karen Bass,Val Demings,Tammy Duckworth,Elizabeth Warren\" data-start=\"2020-03-01 00:00\" width=\"400\" height=\"150\"></canvas>\n\nAs you can see, Harris is the clear front runner. \n\nMany sports bettors and political pundits have been forecasting Harris for a long time and they've seen her appointment as a formality. But the betting data isn't convinced despite **[Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/27/joe-biden-vp-running-mate-pick-tracker-377652)** and other sources saying it's over.\n\n![Biden VP Odds (Democratic Vice Presidential Candidates)?](/images/uploads/biden-vp-odds-kamala-harris.jpg \"Looking for Biden VP Odds (Democratic Vice Presidential Candidates)?\")\n\nHer biggest threats are where it gets interesting. \n\n**Susan Rice** is the big improver in the last few weeks, clearly moving into second position. \n\nAnd then **Karen Bass** skyrocketed into contention, before dropping off a cliff.\n\nThere's been speculative support behind **Tammy Duckworth** but she's back along side **Elizabeth Warren** now.\n\nMeanwhile, **Val Demings** was Kamala Harris' biggest challenger six weeks ago but she's now an unlikely selection.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Our Biden VP Prediction?**\n\nLeveraging the extreme intelligence of **[Tavis Rendell](https://twitter.com/tavisrendell)**, we like two options.\n\nYou have to respect Kamala Harris in the betting market. She has the resume and profile to get the job done. She ticks a lot of boxes.\n\nHowever, we haven't forgotten about **[Tulsi Gabbard verbally KO'ing](https://edition.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/08/01/tulsi-gabbard-kamala-harris-prosecutions-record-cnn-democratic-debate-vpx.cnn)** Harris.\n\nMaybe it's just us (and Gabbard) but doesn't Harris reek of smugness?\n\nWe actually think she'll get rolled. \n\nSo we're going with Rendell's value pick.\n\n**Tammy Duckworth**. \n\nThe double amputee who served in Iraq as a Lieutenant Colonel is a very tough woman for Trump to attack.\n\nDuckworth was 5% when we recommended her last week but she's improved to a 10% chance.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Where Do We Get Accurate Biden VP Odds?**\n\nWe pull data from Betfair where over $3,000,000 USD has been traded. \n\nWe rely exclusively relies on **[The Wisdom Of Crowds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wisdom_of_Crowds)**. Which means everyone's opinion is given weight.\n\nYou will not find a more accurate data source for Biden VP Odds.\n\nKeep coming back to our site as Joe gets closer to a decision.\n\n- - -\n\n## **2020 US Election Odds**\n\nIf you're enjoying our Biden VP Odds graph, make sure you check out the **[Election Odds](https://www.betrefinery.com/us-election-betting/election-betting-odds)**.\n\nYou'll notice that Donald Trump is well behind Joe Biden as the most likely winner of the November Election.",
