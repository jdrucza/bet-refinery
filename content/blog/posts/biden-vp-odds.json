  "body": "Are you looking for **Biden VP Odds**? \n\nYou know that Kamala Harris is the raging favorite from an all female cast of possible **Democratic Vice Presidential Candidates**. But how likely is Harris?\n\nHer odds have been smashed in on the Betfair Exchange, making her a 50-60% chance to ge the job.\n\nBut she's not home yet.\n\nWhat is Harris' probability, and who are her closest challengers?\n\n- - -\n\n## **2020 Biden VP Odds**\n\n<canvas id='g11' name=\"brgraph\" data-file-name=\"DemocraticVPOdds.json\" data-only-names=\"Kamala Harris,Susan Rice,Karen Bass,Val Demings,Tammy Duckworth,Elizabeth Warren\" data-start=\"2020-03-01 00:00\" width=\"400\" height=\"150\"></canvas>\n\nAs you can see, Harris is the clear front runner. \n\nMany sports bettors and political pundits have been forecasting Harris for a long time and they've seen her appointment as a formality. But the betting data isn't convinced despite **[Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/27/joe-biden-vp-running-mate-pick-tracker-377652)** and other sources saying it's over.\n\n![Biden VP Odds (Democratic Vice Presidential Candidates)?](/images/uploads/biden-vp-odds-kamala-harris.jpg \"Looking for Biden VP Odds (Democratic Vice Presidential Candidates)?\")\n\nHer biggest threats are where it gets interesting. \n\nSusan Rice is the big improver in the last few weeks, clearly moving into second position. \n\nAnd Tammy Duckworth isn't far behind.\n\nElizabeth Warren seems to have peaked, similar to her Presidential campaign, but she's certainly capable of a rallying and has the profile.\n\nVal Demings was Kamala Harris' biggest challenger six weeks ago but she's now heading to 5%.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Our Biden VP Prediction?**\n\nLeveraging the extreme intelligence of **[Tavis Rendell](https://twitter.com/tavisrendell)**, we like two options.\n\nYou have to respect Kamala Harris in the betting market.
