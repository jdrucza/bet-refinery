You can get +850 at FanDuel.\n\nIf you place one bet on the AT&T, back Jon Rahm. Two units on the big fella.\n\nBut let's scroll through the feed to see who else is sticking out as a value bet.\n\n**Harris English**. \n\nThe PGA Model says he should be the 10th favorite, at 40-1.\n\nBut you can get 60-1. \n\nLFG!\n\n**Matt Kuchar** at 80-1 is also a bet. The Model loves the Kuch. Hasn't paid out yet but might be worth a Top 10/Top 20 pick.\n\nModel says he should be 58-1. That's a big overlay. \n\n**Rickie Fowler** is also a huge overlay.\n\nWe've been burnt before but 100 vs 75 is a serious probability difference.\n\nSnedeker, Howell and Noren are also value if you like them. \n\nWe'll stick to the guys with more chance, according to the Model.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Final AT&T Byron Nelson Picks**\n\n* **Rahm 2 units @ +850**\n* **English 0.7 units @ 60-1**\n* **Kuchar 0.3 units @ 80-1**\n* **Fowler 0.3 units @ 100-1**\n\n- - -\n\n<div class=\"predictIt\">\n\n**<a href=\"http://join.pointsbet.com/betrefinery-2rf/?utm_source=Unbounce_BetRefinery&utm_medium=Digital_Affiliate_CPA&utm_campaign=Risk_Free_2_500_1000_BetRefinery&utm_term=Unbounce&utm_content=BetRefinery&promo=REFINERY\" target=\"_blank\">WANT GREAT GOLF ODDS?

He makes a healthy living by betting off his sports models. \n\nHis most recent, our golf model, uses the last 15 years of data to produce win predictions for PGA tournaments. The model can be broken down into three stages:\n\n1. **Historic score adjustment** \n\n   Firstly, historic golf scores are adjusted to account for varying course difficulty and conditions on the day. For example a \"-2\" on a certain course/day combination may be an average score but on another course/day combination it might be a great score due to the course being more difficult and/or unfavorable conditions. This adjustment is necessary so that we can compare players on a like for like basis.\n2. **Score prediction** \n\n   We then create features using the adjusted historic scores and run a few machine learning algorithms on top of these, weighting each equally. These provide an accurate prediction for the most likely score that a player will achieve on an average course in the future.\n3. **Simulation**\n\n   Using these future score predictions, for a given tournament we can then simulate each player's score using their own score distribution to come up with win percentages and fair odds for each player in a tournament.\n\n- - -\n\n## **More Golf Betting Expertise**\n\nIf you love betting on golf like us, check out our **[Top 50 World Golf Rankings](https://www.betrefinery.com/golf-betting/world-golf-rankings)**.
