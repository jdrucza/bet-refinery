But while we're building the infrastructure, we go to Betfair. Both the UK and Australian versions. As we know the content providers there and they win at golf.\n\nSo we're collating and refining all the tips from:\n\n* **[Paul Krishnamurty](https://betting.betfair.com/golf/pga-tour/big-price-predictions-and-golf-tips-rbc-heritage-2020-160620-171.html)**\n* **[Steve Rawlings](https://betting.betfair.com/golf/the-punter/rbc-heritage-2020-betting-preview-Bubba-the-best-value-at-harbour-town-160620-167.html)**\n* **[Betfair Golf Model](https://www.betfair.com.au/hub/golf-prediction-model/)**\n* **[Data Golf](https://datagolf.org/live-predictive-model)**\n\n## **RBC Heritage 2020 Picks**\n\nReading through all the expert picks and previous winners, you can see that there's tonnes of value in the guys deeper in the market. \n\n**JT Poston, Bubba Watson, Sam Burns, Tyler Duncan**. Previous winner (twice) and two time runner up, **Jim Furyk**.\n\nOn the **[Course History Tool ](https://datagolf.org/course-history-tool)**at Data Golf, we can see that Harbour Town is fairly predictive. The Links track has narrow fairways and half size greens. You don't need the big stick, more important is accuracy and scrambling. 12 under has been a winning score on several occasions so we know staying out of trouble is as important as aggression. \n\nThe man that comes up frequently is **Matt Kuchar**. He's a previous winner and ran second last year. So we're having him on side, as well as Big **John Rahm**. The Spaniard is well in the market, but still under the odds, compared to his world ranking (2). \n\n**2020 RBC Heritage Picks**\n\n* Back John Rahm for 2 units @ +1900 with Fanduel\n* Back Matt Kuchar for 2 units @ +4000 with BetMGM and Bet America\n* Back Jim Furyk for 1 unit @ +15000 with Fanduel",
