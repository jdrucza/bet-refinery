Unless you're missing fairways. \n\n![](/images/uploads/screen-shot-2021-07-07-at-6.36.58-am.png)\n\nWith that in mind, let's run the Python Model and extract some **John Deere Classic picks**.\n\n- - -\n\n## **John Deere Classic Outputs**\n\nHere are the outputs, and there's details on how the Model was built down the bottom of the page.\n\n<div name=\"brtable\" data-file-name=\"tournamentPredictionsJohnDeere2021.json\" height=\"400px\"></div>\n\nNow, the next step is comparing these outputs vs the market. \n\n- - -\n\n## **John Deere Classic Predictions**\n\nYou're going to need a FoxBet account to really take advantage this week it seems.\n\nThey're top price on half the field.\n\nIncluding the favorite, Daniel Berger. Who is a bet.\n\nModel says +1000 (10-1), Market is 11-1, and FoxBet is 12-1.\n\nZach Johnson is 40-1 Model, 45-1 FoxBet.\n\nThat's a bet most weeks but we're going to back the fav and get some bigger overlay roughies.\n\nOur boy. Your boy. Big Pat Perez. The specimen. Is an incredible bet. \n\nMarket is 100-1 but Model says he's the 14th best player in the field. \n\nThen Chucky Howell and Brice Garnett are both bets too. \n\n- - -\n\n## **Final John Deere Picks**\n\n* Berger at 12-1 for 2 units\n* Perez at 100-1 for 0.3 units\n* Howell at 80-1 for 0.3 units\n* Garnett at 125-1 for 0.2 units\n\n- - -\n\n<div class=\"predictIt\">\n\n**<a href=\"http://join.pointsbet.com/betrefinery-2rf/?utm_source=Unbounce_BetRefinery&utm_medium=Digital_Affiliate_CPA&utm_campaign=Risk_Free_2_500_1000_BetRefinery&utm_term=Unbounce&utm_content=BetRefinery&promo=REFINERY\" target=\"_blank\">WANT GREAT GOLF ODDS?

He makes a healthy living by betting off his sports models. \n\nHis most recent, our golf model, uses the last 15 years of data to produce win predictions for PGA tournaments. The model can be broken down into three stages:\n\n1. **Historic score adjustment** \n\n   Firstly, historic golf scores are adjusted to account for varying course difficulty and conditions on the day. For example a \"-2\" on a certain course/day combination may be an average score but on another course/day combination it might be a great score due to the course being more difficult and/or unfavorable conditions. This adjustment is necessary so that we can compare players on a like for like basis.\n2. **Score prediction** \n\n   We then create features using the adjusted historic scores and run a few machine learning algorithms on top of these, weighting each equally. These provide an accurate prediction for the most likely score that a player will achieve on an average course in the future.\n3. **Simulation**\n\n   Using these future score predictions, for a given tournament we can then simulate each player's score using their own score distribution to come up with win percentages and fair odds for each player in a tournament.\n\n- - -\n\n## **More Golf Betting Expertise**\n\nIf you love betting on golf like us, check out our **[Top 50 World Golf Rankings](https://www.betrefinery.com/golf-betting/world-golf-rankings)**.
