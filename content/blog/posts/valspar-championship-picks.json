Let's see if we can find a runner or two to be fighting on Sunday.\n\n- - -\n\n## **2021 Valspar Championship Outputs**\n\nHere are the outputs from our Model. Details on how it was built are down the bottom of the page.\n\n<div name=\"brtable\" data-file-name=\"tournamentPredictionsValspar2021.json\" height=\"400px\"></div>\n\nNow, the next step is comparing these outputs vs the market. \n\nUntil our odds comparison is ready, we use **[Odds Boom](https://www.oddsboom.com/golf/futures/3900-valspar-championship/)**. \n\n- - -\n\n## **Valspar Championship Picks**\n\nAs the feature image suggests, **Justin Rose** is the man here.\n\nThe back to form Pom is 40-1 with FoxBet but the Model makes him 33-1.\n\nEighth pick from the Model.\n\n**Joaquin Niemann**, the Chile prodigy, is also a bet.\n\nWe like Niemann.\n\nAn even bigger overlay is **Lanto Griffin**. \n\nModel says Lanto is the 13th best golfer in the field, and yet he's 125-1. Yummy.\n\n## **Final Valspar Championship Picks**\n\n* **Rose for 1 unit at 33-1**\n* **Niemann for 1 unit at 40-1**\n* **Griffin for 0.5 units at 125-1**\n\n- - -\n\n<div class=\"predictIt\">\n\n**<a href=\"http://join.pointsbet.com/betrefinery-2rf/?utm_source=Unbounce_BetRefinery&utm_medium=Digital_Affiliate_CPA&utm_campaign=Risk_Free_2_500_1000_BetRefinery&utm_term=Unbounce&utm_content=BetRefinery&promo=REFINERY\" target=\"_blank\">WANT GREAT GOLF ODDS?** \n\n**JOIN POINTSBET</a>**\n\n</div>\n\n- - -\n\n## **Why Should I Care About Your Model?**\n\nGlad you asked.\n\nFirstly, our chief data scientist is no joke. He makes a healthy living by betting off his sports models. \n\nHis most recent, our golf model, uses the last 15 years of data to produce win predictions for PGA tournaments. The model can be broken down into three stages:\n\n1. **Historic score adjustment** \n\n   Firstly, historic golf scores are adjusted to account for varying course difficulty and conditions on the day. For example a \"-2\" on a certain course/day combination may be an average score but on another course/day combination it might be a great score due to the course being more difficult and/or unfavorable conditions. This adjustment is necessary so that we can compare players on a like for like basis.\n2. **Score prediction** \n\n   We then create features using the adjusted historic scores and run a few machine learning algorithms on top of these, weighting each equally. These provide an accurate prediction for the most likely score that a player will achieve on an average course in the future.\n3. **Simulation**\n\n   Using these future score predictions, for a given tournament we can then simulate each player's score using their own score distribution to come up with win percentages and fair odds for each player in a tournament.\n\n- - -\n\n## **More Golf Betting Expertise**\n\nIf you love betting on golf like us, check out our **[Top 50 World Golf Rankings](https://www.betrefinery.com/golf-betting/world-golf-rankings)**.
