  "body": "I fell in love with futures by betting on the NBA Rookie of the Year. You can easily put in more effort than the sportsbooks, to find value.\n\nI remember getting Brandon Jennings at $81 at some backyard offshore book in 2009. \n\nHe didn't win but I had Tyreke Evans as well.\n\nA few years before I went chips in on Brandon Roy at $7. After he and Randy Foye were lighting up the preseason. Despite the Roy / Foye confusion, I picked the right man. \n\nI still have a signed Roy jersey to celebrate that season. Hasn't quite appreciated like I thought it might...\n\nSo I've been betting on ROY for like 15 years.  \n\n**The formula, as you know, is three things:**\n\n* **Talented and able to fill up a box score**\n* **Physically ready** \n* **Court time**\n\nThe last one is the most important.\n\nA rookies location, position competition and coach are variables to pay attention to.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Resources**\n\nFirst and foremost, we look at the odds. Whose favorite and where's the value? \n\n![](/images/uploads/screen-shot-2020-12-22-at-9.48.29-pm.png)\n\nAs you guessed, or probably knew, LaMelo is the fav at +400, but it's a nice open field. \n\nDoesn't resemble the two horse race of last year. Zion was about +150 and Ja Morant +300 when the season started. \n\nSo where's the value in 2021?\n\n- - -\n\n## **LaMelo Ball** \n\nThe man with the brand ticks a lot of boxes.\n\nIn Australia's NBL, one of the strongest international leagues, he stood out against men last year. \n\nHe absolutely lived up to the billing and he's physically ready. \n\nBut he doesn't have the keys to the Hornets offense. In preseason, Rozier and Graham have been starting and LaMelo hasn't lit up preseason, to challenge his protected start. \n\nHe's one to watch. If signs point to him starting early in the season, you can pull the trigger at +400 but we're not doing so at the moment. \n\n- - -\n\n## **James Wisemen** \n\nThe number two pick looks perfectly suited to the Warriors. And he'll likely start. Which increases his ROY chances enormously. \n\nBut we just can't see him lighting up the box score, given his teammates. \n\nPlus, we love to take on rookie big men unless they come in looking like they live in the gym, like  Blake Griffin and Emeka Okafor did.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Anthony Edwards**\n\nThe first pick of the 2020 draft can score and defend. Great size. \n\nBut the TWolves have plenty of first round draft picks on their roster these days. \n\nAfter Russell and Rubio, there's Jarrett Culver and Josh Okogie to compete minutes with. \n\nWe're not convinced Edwards can play 30+ minutes and get his if D'angelo is healthy. \n\n- - -\n\n## **Killian Hayes**\n\nHere’s our bet. +950.\n\nThe starting point guard for the Detroit Pistons. \n\nA first round French American with international experience.\n\nHe’s played in some European pockets that even Australian backpackers are scared to venture to.\n\nThe court time opportunity, the quotes from Dwayne Casey, his position and his experience are all big pluses here.\n\nThe downside? He didn’t light up the box score in preseason.\n\nSo he’s not a can't-miss-blue-chip rookie like the Pistons sixth man, Derrick Rose, who will be eating into Hayes’ court time.\n\nThat said, a top 10 pick that starts at point guard is about all you can ask for a ROY pick. He should be right next to Ball as favorite. \n\n- - -\n\n## **Obi Toppin**\n\nPlenty of Knicks fans and sports bettors are hyping up Obi.\n\n+650 is just way too short. \n\nCoach Thibs isn’t known as a patient rookie lover. And Obi just doesn’t look ready to play big NBA power forward minutes.\n\nWith Knox and Barrett, the Knicks have other lottery picks to give the ball to.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Deni Avdija**\n\nOne to spec on is the small forward for the Wiz. A real chance to start. Mature body and he’s been playing against men for years. Three Israeli league chips for Maccabi Tel Aviv, plus an MVP last season. \n\n+1500 with the books. It’s a pretty weak ROY field. We’ll take that.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Final NBA Rookie of the Year Picks**\n\nWe love to bet up on ROY but it’s hard to go too hard when Hayes isn’t dominating preseason.\n\nHe’s still our man though. Followed by the even juicier odds of Avdija.\n\nLaMelo will be the one to watch. If he can assert his influence and be the first choice guard at Charlotte, anything over +350 is a bet. But right now, you can't be on him.\n\n* Killian Hayes 3 units at +950\n* Deni Avdija 1.5 units at +1500",
