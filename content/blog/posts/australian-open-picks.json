Plus we'll share our futures picks.\n\nWe also rely on a professional tennis bettor called **[Ace](https://publc.com/content/Ace-Tennis-Previews.19235949)**. \n\nWe'll share his hot mail as well.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Australian Open Mens Picks**\n\nOften we try to find value outside of Novak (that hasn't worked out too well). \n\nMedvedev at 100-1 last year. Tsitsipas at 66-1 the year before.\n\nWe'll be betting around Novak again. And our man Ace is probably doing the same.\n\nThere's whispers that the Australian quarantine requirement will deter the Djoker from bringing his team out.\n\nMedvedov and Thiem are the most logical options. Happy to take on the Djoker and Nadal in the futures market. Plus the champion old boy, Fed Express.\n\nSo stay tuned for specific bets on Thiem, Medvedov and any other big roughies that stand out.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Australian Open Mens Odds**\n\n<canvas id='g83' name=\"brgraph\" data-file-name=\"ausOpenMensOdds.json\" data-only-names=\"Novak Djokovic,Daniil Medvedev,Dominic Thiem,Rafael Nadal,Alexander Zverev,Stefanos Tsitsipas,Andrey Rublev,Nick Kyrgios,Jannik Sinner,Alex De Minaur,Andy Murray,Stan Wawrinka,Milos Raonic\" data-start=\"2020-11-15 00:00\" width=\"400\" height=\"150\"></canvas>\n\n- - -\n\n## **Australian Open Womens Picks**\n\nWe love the Ladies. \n\nOur all time best futures ticket was JeÄ¼ena Ostapenko at 200-1!\n\nBut we've had plenty of near misses at the Aussie Open.\n\nThis year, we'll share our favorite futures in January, so stay tuned.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Australian Open Womens Odds**\n\n<canvas id='g84' name=\"brgraph\" data-file-name=\"ausOpenWomensOdds.json\" data-start=\"2020-11-15 00:00\" width=\"400\" height=\"150\"></canvas>",
