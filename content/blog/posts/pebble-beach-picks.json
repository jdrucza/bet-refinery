Patrick Cantlay is a skinny +750 with the sportsbooks.\n\nOur Model crushes on Cantlay hard, so let's see his true probability of winning the tournament. \n\nAnd lets see if any other prospects standout at Pebble Beach.\n\n- - -\n\n## **2021 Pebble Beach Outputs**\n\n<div name=\"brtable\" data-file-name=\"tournamentPredictionsPebbleBeach.json\" height=\"400px\"></div>\n\nNext step is comparing these outputs vs the market. \n\nWe've used **[Odds Checker](https://www.oddschecker.com/us/golf/pebble-beach-pro-am/winner)**. \n\nAfter the manual comparison, we can narrow down our 2021 Pebble Beach Picks.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Pebble Beach Picks**\n\nIt's uncanny how sharp the Model is at the top end.\n\n**Cantlay** is very small overs. His Model probability just under the market odds of +750.\n\nThen **Berger**, **Casey**, **Zalatoris** are all bang on. Model meets market.\n\nBut if we dig a little deeper we find a big name that is returning to form.\n\nNo, not **Jordan Spieth**. The Model hasn't jumped on the Jordy bandwagon.\n\nHowever, it's fallen for **Rickie Fowler**.\n\nThe Model says Rickie is the sixth best player in the field, yet you can 48-1 at FanDuel.\n\nYummy.\n\nThat's a big discrepancy from the 37-1 the Model has.\n\n**Brian Harman** is just value at 50-1 but we much prefer **Jim Furyk**.\n\nFuryk is 100-1 with every sportsbook but the model has him 66-1. Yuge. Bet it.\n\nFuryk won some old man events in 2020 and finished Top 50 against the toughest fields on multiple occasions. He's consistent and still has it.\n\n**Ryan Moore** stands out as a bet at 125-1 too.\n\nYou can also make a case for the vintage South African, **Rory Sabbatini**. But we'll pass there as the value is stronger for our three favorite bets.\n\n## **Final Picks**\n\n* 1 unit on Rickie Fowler to win at 48-1\n* 0.5 units on Jim Furyk to win at 100-1\n* 1 unit Jim Furyk Top 20 at +425 with Bet365\n* 0.25 units on Ryan Moore to win at 125-1\n\n- - -\n\n<div class=\"predictIt\">\n\n**<a href=\"http://join.pointsbet.com/betrefinery-2rf/?utm_source=Unbounce_BetRefinery&utm_medium=Digital_Affiliate_CPA&utm_campaign=Risk_Free_2_500_1000_BetRefinery&utm_term=Unbounce&utm_content=BetRefinery&promo=REFINERY\" target=\"_blank\">WANT GREAT GOLF ODDS?

He makes a healthy living by betting off his sports models. \n\nHis most recent, our golf model, uses the last 15 years of data to produce win predictions for PGA tournaments. The model can be broken down into three stages:\n\n1. **Historic score adjustment** \n\n   Firstly, historic golf scores are adjusted to account for varying course difficulty and conditions on the day. For example a \"-2\" on a certain course/day combination may be an average score but on another course/day combination it might be a great score due to the course being more difficult and/or unfavorable conditions. This adjustment is necessary so that we can compare players on a like for like basis.\n2. **Score prediction** \n\n   We then create features using the adjusted historic scores and run a few machine learning algorithms on top of these, weighting each equally. These provide an accurate prediction for the most likely score that a player will achieve on an average course in the future.\n3. **Simulation**\n\n   Using these future score predictions, for a given tournament we can then simulate each player's score using their own score distribution to come up with win percentages and fair odds for each player in a tournament.\n\n- - -\n\n## **More Golf Betting Expertise**\n\nIf you love betting on golf like us, check out our **[Top 50 World Golf Rankings](https://www.betrefinery.com/golf-betting/world-golf-rankings)**.
