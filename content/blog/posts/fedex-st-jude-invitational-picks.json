That way we can find which outputs of ours are much shorter than the market. \n\nIn the next few weeks we'll make the outputs vs the market even easier to read.\n\nUntil then, here are the players that stood out:\n\n* **Patrick Cantlay** (world number three in our opinion)\n* **Sergio Garcia**\n* **Gary Woodland**\n* **Abraham Ancer**\n* **Adam Hadwin**\n\nNow, we could back all five, but we'll skew our betting to the biggest overlays.\n\nThat is the 2017 Masters winner, Sergio Garcia. And Patrick Cantlay.\n\n### **Patrick Cantlay**\n\nHe might have only won two PGA Tour tournaments so far, but he's so consistent. And a perennial favorite of Bet Refinery. We might have backed him 15 times last year as he sky rocketed up the PGA Rankings. Of course we didn't get a collect.\n\nBut his talent is undeniable. He's also finished 11th and 7th in the Covid relaunch from three starts.\n\nOur model marks him a clear third choice at 16-1.\n\nYou can get 20-1 with Pointsbet, Fanduel and BetMGM.\n\n### **Sergio Garcia**\n\nThe famous Spaniard feels like he's been around since Jack Nicklaus was winning jackets but he's fresher than you realize at 40 years old.\n\nOur model believes he's a 44-1 chance of winning the 2020 FedEx St Jude Invitational. But you can get him at 70-1 at BetMGM and Fanduel.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Bet Against DJ**\n\nYou can also find value in the players that the model dislikes.\n\nDustin Johnson is the clear standout. \n\nRated 35-1 by the market and 120-1 by our model.\n\nHe won The Travelers in June but had a horrendous showing at The Memorial and withdrew last week.\n\nSo let's search the sportsbooks for DJ props.\n\nThe best we've found so far is a tournament match-up with Brooks Koepka. But that's fraught with danger. Another big tournament player that can do nothing if he isn't in the killer mood. \n\nSo we'll keep searching for DJ props and let you know what we spot on **[@Twitter](https://twitter.com/BetRefinery)**\n\n- - -\n\n## **Final FedEx St Jude Invitational Picks**\n\nBack **Patrick Cantlay** for 1 unit\n\n* 20-1 with Pointsbet, Fanduel and BetMGM.\n\nBack **Sergio Garcia** for 1 unit\n\n* 70-1 at BetMGM and Fanduel\n\n- - -\n\n## **More Golf Expertise**\n\nDon't forget to check out our **[2020 Guide on Golf Betting](https://www.betrefinery.com/golf-betting/how-to-bet-on-golf)**.",
