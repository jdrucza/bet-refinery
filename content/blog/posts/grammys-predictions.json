And that definitely includes entertainment and political markets.\n\nSo let's analyze the 2021 Grammys, where the betting markets are dominated by the divas.\n\nIn this Grammys Predictions piece, we'll look at the most popular betting markets:\n\n> * Record Of The Year\n> * Album Of The Year\n> * Song of the Year\n> * Best New Artist\n\nFirstly, we'll highlight the favorites and show the recent market movements. Then we'll refresh the content a week before the Grammys are announced with clear betting recommendations.\n\nNow, onto the markets.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Album Of The Year**\n\nTaylor Swift is the hot favorite in a head to head with Dua Lipa here.\n\nPost Malone and the new Coldplay album are in the betting market but there hasn't been any support.\n\nAt this stage, Taylor's Folklore is absolutely the album to beat.\n\n<canvas id='g121' name=\"brgraph\" data-file-name=\"grammysAlbumYear.json\" data-only-names=\"Folklore-Taylor Swift,Future Nostalgia-Dua Lipa\" data-start=\"2021-02-26 00:00\" width=\"400\" height=\"150\"></canvas>\n\n- - -\n\n## **Record Of The Year**\n\nCan someone tell us the difference between a record and a song and an album?\n\nWe thought a song was a song. An album was a lot of songs. And a record was what you called an album before 1988.\n\nAnyway...\n\nThe 2021 Record Of The Year market is another triple threat match.\n\nBut Dua Lipa's Don't Start Now is a comprehensive favorite.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oygrmJFKYZY\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<canvas id='g120' name=\"brgraph\" data-file-name=\"grammysRecordYear.json\" data-only-names=\"Don't Start Now - Dua Lipa,Black Parade - Beyonce,Circles - Post Malone\" data-start=\"2021-02-26 00:00\" width=\"400\" height=\"150\"></canvas>\n\n- - -\n\n## **Song Of The Year**\n\nCardigan has been backed in from +130 ($2.30) and will start favorite in a triple threat match.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/K-a8s8OLBSE\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nDon't Start Now is the biggest challenger with Beyonce's Black Parade looking friendless in betting at this stage.\n\nCall us simpleton's but 81M YoutTube views vs 470M views, Dua Lipa has to be in with a show here. The song came out six months earlier but this might be the market to watch for an upset on Grammy night.\n\n<canvas id='g122' name=\"brgraph\" data-file-name=\"grammysSongYear.json\" data-only-names=\"Cardigan - Taylor Swift,Don't Start Now - Dua Lipa,Black Parade - Beyonce\" data-start=\"2021-02-26 00:00\" width=\"400\" height=\"150\"></canvas>\n\n- - -\n\n## **Best New Artist**\n\n<canvas id='g123' name=\"brgraph\" data-file-name=\"grammysBestNewArtist.json\" data-only-names=\"Megan Thee Stallion,Doja Cat,Phoebe Bridgers\" data-start=\"2021-02-26 00:00\" width=\"400\" height=\"150\"></canvas>\n\n- - -",
