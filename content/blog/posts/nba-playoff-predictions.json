The three prong star power is completely overvalued by dumb money, and therefore, the sportsbooks keep the price too low.\n\nIn the East, you want the **Bucks**. Clearly. It just doesn't respect the **76ers** like the Market. Giannis and co are a huge overlay. \n\nDon't forget how short they were last year, trading at +400 most the season.\n\nBack to the West, the **Lakers** and **Clippers** are huge title hopes, but they are too short at the moment.\n\nThe **Nuggets** and **Suns** are actually the value picks.\n\nFinally, the Raptors are a huge overlay in the East.\n\nTo sum that up, the best value is:\n\n1. **Jazz**\n2. **Bucks**\n3. **Suns, Nuggets, Raptor**\n\n- - -\n\n## **More NBA Resources**\n\nWe LOVE betting futures.
