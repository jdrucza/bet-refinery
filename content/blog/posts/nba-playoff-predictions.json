Hopefully you were subscribed to our email list and backed them at 25-1 or better.\n\nBeyod the Jazz, let's look which other teams are being overlooked by the books in 2021.\n\n- - -\n\n## **NBA Playoff Predictions**\n\nThis bad boy is updated every day.\n\nCommentary below is updated by Monday each week.\n\nSort the table to your liking (we're still working on the UX).\n\n<div name=\"brtable\" data-api-name=\"nba_futures\"></div>\n\n- - -\n\n<div class=\"predictIt\">\n\nWant **the biggest promos?**\n\nStart with **$2,000** in bonus bets.\n\n**<a href=\"https://join.pointsbet.com/betrefinery-2rf/?utm_source=Unbounce_BetRefinery&utm_medium=Digital_Affiliate_CPA&utm_campaign=Risk_Free_2_500_1000_BetRefinery&utm_term=Unbounce&utm_content=BetRefinery&promo=REFINERY\">JOIN POINTSBET NOW!</a>**\n\n</div>\n\n- - -\n\n## **NBA Futures Interpretation**\n\nLet's start by looking at the best odds from all the sportsbooks, courtesy of Odds Boom.\n\nThis was provided on the 1st of March:\n\n![nba playoff predictions](/images/uploads/screen-shot-2021-03-01-at-8.13.58-am.png \"nba playoff predictions\")\n\nTwo teams we've been recommending for weeks, got even shorter. \n\nPhoenix 50-1 into 42-1. \n\nAnd the Jazz are down to 8-1. Still too big.\n\nThe Model has long loved the Bucks and sees them winning the East. Which we're paying attention too, but it's hard to believe Brooklyn's odds are still this high with their recent wins. \n\nThe Nets are a big chance to finish first in the East and their odds don't quite reflect that. \n\nBut we do feel the Model has been deliberate around Philly, unconvinced of their Title winning prospects. Outside of big Joe, the **[Player Model](https://www.betrefinery.com/nba-betting/nba-player-rankings)** questions whether Philly is up to it.\n\nLastly, the Raptors are respected in the Eastern.\n\n## **NBA Playoff Predictions**\n\nOutside of the Title, the Model is obviously trying to predict who makes the Playoffs.\n\nWe love watching the West with Dallas, Golden State, New Orleans, Portland and the Spurs fighting out for finite playoffs spots. \n\nWe love seeing Zion's Pelicans as the most likely, as they provide great value with the books. \n\nIn the East, we like to keep our eyes on New York and Charlotte.\n\n- - -\n\n## **More NBA Resources**\n\nWe LOVE betting futures.
