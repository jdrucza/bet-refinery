  "body": "Our NBA Model has your exclusive **NBA Playoff Predictions** populating all year.\n\nThe automated table below populates at the end of each down, however, our commentary is updated at the start of every week.\n\nYou can sort the table to see your team's chance of making the playoffs, to winning the chip.\n\nWe obviously use this data to snipe sportsbooks.\n\nUtah was a huge edge, and still is, for the NBA Title.\n\nOur **NBA Playoff Predictions** Model has had the Jazz at shorter than half the sportsbooks' odds since early December 2020. Hopefully you were subscribed to our email list and backed them at 25-1 or better.\n\nBeyod the Jazz, let's look which other teams are being overlooked by the books in 2021.\n\n- - -\n\n## **NBA Playoff Predictions**\n\nThis bad boy is updated every day.\n\nCommentary below is updated by Monday each week.\n\nSort the table to your liking (we're still working on the UX).\n\n<div name=\"brtable\" data-api-name=\"nba_futures\"></div>\n\n- - -\n\n<div class=\"predictIt\">\n\nWant **the biggest promos?**\n\nStart with **$2,000** in bonus bets.\n\n**<a href=\"https://join.pointsbet.com/betrefinery-2rf/?utm_source=Unbounce_BetRefinery&utm_medium=Digital_Affiliate_CPA&utm_campaign=Risk_Free_2_500_1000_BetRefinery&utm_term=Unbounce&utm_content=BetRefinery&promo=REFINERY\">JOIN POINTSBET NOW!</a>**\n\n</div>\n\n- - -\n\n## **NBA Futures Interpretation**\n\nLet's start by looking at the best odds from all the sportsbooks, courtesy of Odds Boom.\n\nThis was provided on the 20th of April:\n\n![nba playoff predictions](/images/uploads/nba-championship-odds-bet-refinery-oddschecker-april.png \"nba playoff predictions\")\n\nFirst of all. A little headwobble. \n\nThe Model clearly recommended a Knicks playoff bet before Xmas at odds over +450. \n\nAs impressively, it recommended the Jazz at 50-1 and Suns at 40-1 for the title.\n\nRight now, it throws huge shade at the Nets. We thought the Model was broken or taking weeks to update. Turns out it's probably just aligned with the Ben Simmons' quote. There's one ball, and you need to play defense, not just offense.\n\nWith that in mind, the **Sixers** are the clear pick on the East side of the draw. Model says +600 for Philly, but the books are betting +1200.\n\nModel also been huge on the **Bucks** all year and there's slight overs there. \n\nOut West, despite the Mitchell ankle injury, Jazz are a huge overlay. FoxBet are +1000, the Model is +300.\n\nAnd the Suns are still huge overs.\n\nDespite backing the Jazz at 50-1 and Suns at 40-1, there is still meat on the bone. Don't be afraid to bet on the two teams with the best records. \n\nThe NBA media and casual fan is convinced LA and Brooklyn will be healthy when the Playoffs start. And talent will overcome. But what if they don't? You'll be sick on yourself for not backing the three teams with the best records in the league at double digit odds.\n\n### **NBA Playoff Predictions in April:**\n\n* **Philly +1200**\n* **Phoenix +2700**\n* **Jazz +1000**\n\nYou can make a case for Denver according to the Model but it's obviously not aware of the Jamal Murray injury.\n\nModel also likes Boston but we're so burnt out on the Cs. Went hard at 25-1 at the start of the season.\n\n- - -\n\n## **More NBA Resources**\n\nWe LOVE betting futures.
