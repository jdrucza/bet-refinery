Sportsbooks love putting Brooks two or three rolls under his true odds, as they know they'll lay bets on him regardless.\n\nSo that leaves us with two bets.\n\nThe first is **Gary Woodland**. As the subject line of this article suggested. We love the big fella and can make a case that he is overs in the win and first round leader markets.\n\nWe've also got a tiny overround on big **Tony Finau**. So we'll play that too.\n\nMayakoba is a relaxed venue so we'll do some relaxed December betting. Not go too hard but make sure we have something to watch.\n\n## **Final Picks**\n\n* Tony Finau - 1 unit to win at 25-1 with BetMGM or Borgata\n* Gary Woodland - 0.5 units to win at 80-1 with BetMGM or Borgata\n* Gary Woodland - 1 unit First Round Leader at 66-1\n\n- - -\n\n<div class=\"predictIt\">\n\n**<a href=\"http://join.pointsbet.com/betrefinery-2rf/?utm_source=Unbounce_BetRefinery&utm_medium=Digital_Affiliate_CPA&utm_campaign=Risk_Free_2_500_1000_BetRefinery&utm_term=Unbounce&utm_content=BetRefinery&promo=REFINERY\" target=\"_blank\">WANT GREAT GOLF ODDS?

He makes a healthy living by betting off his sports models. \n\nHis most recent, our golf model, uses the last 15 years of data to produce win predictions for PGA tournaments. The model can be broken down into three stages:\n\n1. **Historic score adjustment** \n\n   Firstly, historic golf scores are adjusted to account for varying course difficulty and conditions on the day. For example a \"-2\" on a certain course/day combination may be an average score but on another course/day combination it might be a great score due to the course being more difficult and/or unfavorable conditions. This adjustment is necessary so that we can compare players on a like for like basis.\n2. **Score prediction** \n\n   We then create features using the adjusted historic scores and run a few machine learning algorithms on top of these, weighting each equally. These provide an accurate prediction for the most likely score that a player will achieve on an average course in the future.\n3. **Simulation**\n\n   Using these future score predictions, for a given tournament we can then simulate each player's score using their own score distribution to come up with win percentages and fair odds for each player in a tournament.\n\n- - -\n\n## **More Golf Betting Expertise**\n\nIf you love betting on golf like us, check out our **[Top 50 World Golf Rankings](https://www.betrefinery.com/golf-betting/world-golf-rankings)**.
