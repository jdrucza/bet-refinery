You can go **[here](http://www.owgr.com/ranking)** for the square version.\n\nWe're giving you the **betting version** of the World Golf Rankings. Where recent form counts for more. Where you can't win two tournaments seven months ago and sit at number five.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Bet Refinery World Golf Rankings**\n\nWhat an incredibly tight fight at the top. \n\n**Jon Rahm** returns to the top of the food chain, narrowly edging **Xander** and **JT**. \n\n**Webb Simpson's** Covid form has him nudging Rory, to find fourth spot. \n\nDJ is the big riser after an incredible Tour win at the Northern Trust. But he's only as high as 12th. Nowhere near the official ranking, which has him first!\n\nWe love seeing this difference in opinion as we back the model over the official ranking. We back it so much we bet on it.\n\nCheck out the top 50 world golf rankings (according to our Model) below:\n\n![World Golf Rankings Bet Refinery](/images/uploads/image-6-.png \"World Golf Rankings | Top Golfers\")\n\n- - -\n\n## **Golf Picks**\n\nPGA Champ picks are on the way. \n\nPlus, don't forget our **[Expert Betting Guide](https://www.betrefinery.com/golf-betting/how-to-bet-on-golf)**.",
