  "body": "You want to know the **World Golf Rankings** after each week of the PGA Tour? \n\nBet Refinery has got your back.\n\nHowever, we're not giving you the official ones. You can go **[here](http://www.owgr.com/ranking)** for the square version.\n\nWe're giving you the **betting version** of the World Golf Rankings.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Bet Refinery World Golf Rankings**\n\nNow this might surprise you given the tear **Dustin Johnson** is on. But we think there are two golfers in the world that eclipse him.\n\nThe official world number two, **Jon Rahm**, has been our number one golfer in the world for months. Before his BMW Championship win. And before his Memorial win back in July!\n\nSecond? **Xander Schauffele**. We back him nearly every start and he ends up 'winning' the Tour Championship if everyone started on scratch. But DJ got the cash, starting five shots in front.\n\nNevertheless, our Model clearly doesn't recognize DJ's performances as well as the official rankings or the market. So we'll look to fade him in match-ups with the other two guys. A strategy that didn't work too well with Jon Rahm last week. But we trust the process.\n\nThe next two golfers won't surprise. **JT** then **Rory**. Makes sense.\n\n**Cantlay**, **Scheffler**, **Matsuyama** and **Adam Scott** might surprise as your top 10 then. Above some bigger names. So expect them to stand out in betting options as the next couple of big tournaments approach.\n\nCheck out the top 50 world golf rankings (according to our Model) below:\n\ngolfRankings.json\n\n- - -\n\n## **Golf Picks**\n\nKeep an eye out for our weekly predictions and don't forget our **[Expert Betting Guide](https://www.betrefinery.com/golf-betting/how-to-bet-on-golf)**.",
