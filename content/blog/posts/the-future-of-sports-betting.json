Think FanDuel vs DraftKings vs BetMGM vs Barstool etc.\n\nPlus we're also going to discuss the influence of some tech heavy exchanges.\n\nHave you heard of **Polymarket**, **Kalshi** or **Sporttrade** yet?\n\nLFG.\n\n- - -\n\n## **US Sports Betting Environment**\n\nFirstly. We know the States are broke AF. \n\nLike me with two kids and a wife with taste.\n\nCovid lockdowns and hurting small businesses, has helped **[Cuomo backflip in NY](https://www.si.com/gambling/2021/04/21/online-sports-betting-allowed-in-new-york)**. \n\n**[Florida are fasttracking their legalization and Arizona are nearly good to go](https://www.legalsportsreport.com/50949/sports-betting-news-april-26-2021/)**. With many more states to presumably follow.\n\nAnd Canada are **[getting in on the action](https://www.cbc.ca/sports/the-buzzer-newsletter-canada-legalizing-sports-betting-1.6000435)** too.\n\nSo the billion dollar gold rush is years ahead of where most of it thought it would be.\n\nThat Chinese virus has helped Flutter (FanDuel / Sportsbet in Australia / Paddy Power / Betfair) more than you can possibly imagine. \n\n- - -\n\n## **Current 2021 Competitors**\n\n**FanDuel** and **DraftKings** dominate. Arguably competing over 70%+ of the pie, with FanDuel winning.\n\n**PointsBet** were early movers but **BetMGM** and **Barstool** are your best bets for third pick. More on our predictions shortly.\n\nThen you've got the world champion, **Bet365**, and Caesar's acqusition **William Hill**.\n\nHills were actually on US soil first and are a huge brand in the UK, but they haven't made their presence felt yet.\n\nThen some much smaller Europeans in **Unibet/888 Sports** and **Tipico**.\n\nCanada is represented by **The Score** and there are some duplicate US brands like **FoxBet**. Plus whatever **Twinspires/Bet America** want to be called today.\n\nLike most oligopolies (a word I haven't used since year 12 economics), the big dogs eat most the food.\n\nAfter FanDuel and DraftKings, there might only be 30% on the table. And most of that is gobbled up by BetMGM, Barstool and PointsBet.\n\nNow that we've broadly shared the lay of the land, let's get predicting.\n\n- - -\n\n## **2025 Forecast**\n\nI'll make this simple and share my market share predictions.\n\nFanDuel will beat DraftKings.\n\nI bet on that buy buying Flutter on the UK stock market. \n\nFanDuel's parent company invented the current success formula. \n\nCreate a fun brand, spend insane cash on marketing, lure players with sign up offers and promotions, sponsor events, have betting markets on almost everything. Bet decent odds, but don't focus on price.\n\nIt's Flutter's Model. And to beat the man, you can't copy the man.\n\nSo I actually think the FanDuel lead over DraftKings will only get bigger, however DK will still maintain position two.\n\nBetMGM, with a sh*t tonne of cash from the US and UK, will compete heard for the third spot.\n\nBut I'm putting my chips on Davey Portnoy and co. They have an enormous database of perfect customers. Recreational mugs who bet for fun. And Barstool has the brand.\n\nUnless the Penn product sucks, I see them just beating BetMGM.\n\nPointsBet, will be a distant fifth. \n\nA stab at the market share would be:\n\n* FanDuel 35%\n* DraftKings 25%\n* Barstool 13%\n* BetMGM 11%\n* PointsBet 6%\n* Bet365 4%\n* William Hill 2%\n\nThe rest will have crumbs.",
