  "body": "Let's run our sports betting Model to find our **2021 Honda Classic Picks**.\n\nIn recent tournament, the Model has been as premature as a lucky 17 year old.\n\nCan you say that?\n\nOr, as preamture as a baby born at 36 weeks?\n\nI prefer the former metaphor. \n\nThe Model has been hyping up Lee Westwood for months, but hasn't made a cent. It's also forecasted the consistent Matt Fitzpatrick form.\n\nAnd painfully, we even found an overlay on the Players last week for Justin Thomas but we bet around him!\n\nFark me.\n\nAnyway, that's futures golf for you and we're ready for more pain this week.\n\nSo let's fire up the Model and find some delicious **Honda Classic Picks**.\n\n- - -\n\n## **2021 Honda Classic Outputs**\n\nHere are the outputs from our Model. Details on how it was built are down the bottom of the page.\n\n<div name=\"brtable\" data-file-name=\"tournamentPredictionsHondaClassic2021.json\" height=\"400px\"></div>\n\nNow, the next step is comparing these outputs vs the market. \n\n- - -\n\n## **Honda Classic Picks**\n\nAfter running the numbers, we're completely spoilt for choice.\n\nWe've had the Model live for nearly a year now and I've never seen so many significant overlays.\n\nWhat we mean is the probability assigned by the Model is significantly shorter than what the sportsbooks will pay out.\n\nThere's 12+ players that you can back. We'll list them all, then share the best bets (determined by the most value):\n\n* **Joaquin Niemann**\n* **Adam Scott**\n* **Ian Poulter**\n* **Jim Furyk**\n* **Zach Johnson**\n* **Kevin Streelman**\n* **Ryan Moore**\n* **Adam Hadwin**\n* **Martin Kaymer**\n* **Matt Jones**\n* **Rickie Fowler**\n* **MacKenzie Hughes**\n\nNow let's find the greatest value.\n\nFor example, Niemann is 18.52 on the Model, and 19.00 (18-1) on the Market.\n\nThat's not big enough when there are so many overlays.\n\nWe're going to shortlist our favs.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Final Honda Classic Picks**\n\n* Adam Scott for 1.5 units at 28-1\n* Ian Poulter for 0.75 units at 70-1\n* Jim Furyk for 0.75 units at 125-1\n* Zach Johnson for 0.75 units at 75-1\n* Kevin Streelman for 0.75 units at 75-1\n* Ryan Moore for 0.5 units at 90-1\n\nLooks like too many bets but the overs are irresistable and we'd be sick if we didn't sprinkle a little on Moore and Streelman, and they won.\n\n- - -\n\n<div class=\"predictIt\">\n\n**<a href=\"http://join.pointsbet.com/betrefinery-2rf/?utm_source=Unbounce_BetRefinery&utm_medium=Digital_Affiliate_CPA&utm_campaign=Risk_Free_2_500_1000_BetRefinery&utm_term=Unbounce&utm_content=BetRefinery&promo=REFINERY\" target=\"_blank\">WANT GREAT GOLF ODDS?** \n\n**JOIN POINTSBET</a>**\n\n</div>\n\n- - -\n\n## **Why Should I Care About Your Model?**\n\nGlad you asked.\n\nFirstly, our chief data scientist is no joke. He makes a healthy living by betting off his sports models. \n\nHis most recent, our golf model, uses the last 15 years of data to produce win predictions for PGA tournaments. The model can be broken down into three stages:\n\n1. **Historic score adjustment** \n\n   Firstly, historic golf scores are adjusted to account for varying course difficulty and conditions on the day. For example a \"-2\" on a certain course/day combination may be an average score but on another course/day combination it might be a great score due to the course being more difficult and/or unfavorable conditions. This adjustment is necessary so that we can compare players on a like for like basis.\n2. **Score prediction** \n\n   We then create features using the adjusted historic scores and run a few machine learning algorithms on top of these, weighting each equally. These provide an accurate prediction for the most likely score that a player will achieve on an average course in the future.\n3. **Simulation**\n\n   Using these future score predictions, for a given tournament we can then simulate each player's score using their own score distribution to come up with win percentages and fair odds for each player in a tournament.\n\n- - -\n\n## **More Golf Betting Expertise**\n\nIf you love betting on golf like us, check out our **[Top 50 World Golf Rankings](https://www.betrefinery.com/golf-betting/world-golf-rankings)**.
