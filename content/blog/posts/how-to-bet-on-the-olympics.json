  "body": "Every four years (or five, #covid) we get a really unique betting opportunity.\n\nThe Olympics. \n\nRoughly 400 events to bet on, consisting of sports, athletes and countries (!) we've barely heard of. \n\nThe fun part about the Olympics is that the sportsbook traders have as much idea as you.\n\nWhich means two things:\n\n1. You can find an edge with a little research\n2. You won't be able to bet big because the sportsbooks limit their exposure\n\nNow we've been betting through about four Olympics and have learnt some hard lessons along the way.\n\nWe'll try to pass those along here and add some tipping accounts/resources to follow as the 2021 Tokyo Olympics gets ready to launch.\n\n- - -\n\n## **How To Bet On The Olympics**\n\nConsistent with other broad recommendations on the site, we have two tips:\n\n1. Shop around and have accounts at many sportsbooks\n2. Focus on a couple of sports, don't bet on every event\n\nYou never know which sportsbooks will have the best market offering until the events start. Although, we should be able to make some assumptions as the opening ceremony approaches. Whichever book has lots of prop markets on medals and early individual events will continue having the best depth as the Olympics start.\n\nHowever, it's not just about range of markets. It always pays to shop around. Pun intended.\n\nSecondly, don't just follow the live tv coverage and bet on every event. Be selective. Find a few sports with lots of events, and do your homework.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Which Sports To Focus On?**\n\nI've historically had a tough time with swimming but its an incredible sport to focus on because of the volume of events. Mens + Womens, multiple strong athletes in each event. You can often find great odds.\n\nSimilarly, if you love hoops and are happy watching European teams battle it out, not just Team USA, then there are plenty of bets to be found in the basketball tournament. \n\nPersonally, I love watching the market movement on weightlifting and wrestling. Which completely goes against my advice of niching down, but you can find some unbeatable favorites, or some strong market movement.\n\nWhich brings me to my next point.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Follow The Money**\n\nWe'll do our best to have Betfair money movements for the major events. You'll see the weight of money (which doesn't take much in the Olympics) move prices around on the world's biggest betting exchange.\n\nFor example, here's the early market for the Mens 100m:\n\n<canvas id='g137' name=\"brgraph\" data-file-name=\"olympicsMens100m.json\" data-only-names=\"Trayvon Bromell,Andre de Grasse,Christian Coleman\" data-start=\"2021-04-12 00:00\" width=\"400\" height=\"150\"></canvas>\n\nOn top of that, I like to check **[Pinnacle](https://www.pinnacle.com/en/)**. They accept bets from the world's biggest customers and already have a market leading offering by betting on 240+ events! Most places have a handful right now.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\n1. Shop around for best odds and most markets as sportsbooks will vary greatly during the Olympics.\n2. Try to focus on one or two main sports with lots of events.\n3. Do your homework and study the lead up events of the last few years.\n4. And watch the market movements on Betfair and Pinnacle.\n\nPlus, of course, return to Bet Refinery as the Olympics kicks off. We'll be sharing the sharpest information we can find.\n\n- - -\n\n#### **We'll be sharing weekly tips during the Olympics.
