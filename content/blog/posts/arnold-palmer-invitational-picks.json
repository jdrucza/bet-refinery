All be right in the mix on Sunday, but no Johnny Cash.\n\nBut that's the nature of golf betting if you're trying to pick the winner at average odds of about 50-1.\n\nRide the variance baby. She's a cruel master but it's worked for us for the last decade.\n\nBet through the pain. \n\nSo let's fire up the Model again and look for the valuable **Arnold Palmer Invitational Picks**.\n\n- - -\n\n## **2021 Arnold Palmer Invitational Outputs**\n\nHere are the outputs from our Model. Details on how it was built are down the bottom of the page.\n\n<div name=\"brtable\" data-file-name=\"tournamentPredictionsArnoldPalmer.json\" height=\"400px\"></div>\n\nNow, the next step is comparing these outputs vs the market. \n\nUntil our odds comparison is ready, we use **[Odds Boom](https://www.oddsboom.com/golf/futures/2462-the-genesis-invitational/)**. \n\n- - -\n\n## **Arnold Palmer Invitational Picks**\n\nAs you can see from the outputs, our projections largely match the market at the top end.\n\n**Rory** from **Viktor** and **Bryson**. But there's no value to be had.\n\nWe thought **Matthew Fitzpatrick** would stick out for the third week in a row, but the market has caught up. Based on his very competitive performances.\n\nSame thing with **Billy Horschel**.\n\nScrolling further, some names that do stand out on the market, are:\n\n* **Louis Oosthuizen**\n* **Harris English**\n* **Justin Rose**\n* **Corey Conners**\n* **Kevin Kisner**\n\nWe'll give Louie a miss as he isn't the significant overlay that the other four guys are.\n\nYou could look at Top 5, 10, 20 markets for these guys, but we're gonna go for gold here at huge odds.\n\nThis isn't the toughest PGA field so let's see if we can jag one.\n\n## **Final Arnold Palmer Invitational Picks**\n\n* **0.4 units on English at 60-1 with FanDuel**\n* **0.35 units on Rose at 70-1 at BetMGM**\n* **0.3 units on Conners at 100-1 at PointsBet**\n* **0.3 units on Kisner at 90-1 at BetMGM**\n\n- - -\n\n<div class=\"predictIt\">\n\n**<a href=\"http://join.pointsbet.com/betrefinery-2rf/?utm_source=Unbounce_BetRefinery&utm_medium=Digital_Affiliate_CPA&utm_campaign=Risk_Free_2_500_1000_BetRefinery&utm_term=Unbounce&utm_content=BetRefinery&promo=REFINERY\" target=\"_blank\">WANT GREAT GOLF ODDS?** \n\n**JOIN POINTSBET</a>**\n\n</div>\n\n- - -\n\n## **Why Should I Care About Your Model?**\n\nGlad you asked.\n\nFirstly, our chief data scientist is no joke. He makes a healthy living by betting off his sports models. \n\nHis most recent, our golf model, uses the last 15 years of data to produce win predictions for PGA tournaments. The model can be broken down into three stages:\n\n1. **Historic score adjustment** \n\n   Firstly, historic golf scores are adjusted to account for varying course difficulty and conditions on the day. For example a \"-2\" on a certain course/day combination may be an average score but on another course/day combination it might be a great score due to the course being more difficult and/or unfavorable conditions. This adjustment is necessary so that we can compare players on a like for like basis.\n2. **Score prediction** \n\n   We then create features using the adjusted historic scores and run a few machine learning algorithms on top of these, weighting each equally. These provide an accurate prediction for the most likely score that a player will achieve on an average course in the future.\n3. **Simulation**\n\n   Using these future score predictions, for a given tournament we can then simulate each player's score using their own score distribution to come up with win percentages and fair odds for each player in a tournament.\n\n- - -\n\n## **More Golf Betting Expertise**\n\nIf you love betting on golf like us, check out our **[Top 50 World Golf Rankings](https://www.betrefinery.com/golf-betting/world-golf-rankings)**.
