But how many of them are professional sports bettors? 1%, 2%? \n\nMost of UFC Picks you'll find are from someone who doesn't bet or loses more than most. \n\nAt Bet Refinery, we leverage the expertise of full time sports bettors and there are few betting in the UFC space than **[Gugabe](https://twitter.com/Gugabed)**. \n\nOur man makes a full time living on the sport.\n\nWe're honored to have his tips on Bet Refinery for free.\n\nFor the extra special sauce including his props (which he dominates), pay the man **[HERE](https://www.betmma.tips/mma_handicapper_stats.php?ID=118760)**.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Derrick Lewis vs Alexei Oleynik**\n\nThis fight is peak Heavyweight. \n\nDerrick Lewis is an institution in the division, but could very easily be 0-6 in his last six fights without some miraculous comebacks and razor-thin decisions. \n\nOleynik is 10,000 years old and does cagefighting as a side hustle from his main career of being a militia leader in the Ukraine. But I don’t think that the 10,000 year old should be this big a dog against Derrick Lewis. I mark this as a lot closer to a coinflip, and one in which Oleynik should both be the better minute-winner and has more paths to victory. \n\nWhich isn’t saying that this fight doesn’t end by massive Lewis haymaker at a fair clip, but I’ve appreciated the recent shift in Oleynik’s gameplan towards pressure, bodypunching and his still-extant submission game. \n\nLewis is very fragile to body-hits, and the gameplan that Oleynik used against Overeem of immediately forcing the clinch and hammering the body with hard uppercuts could easily be a winning one here. That’s on top of the very-live possibility of any sort of takedown or grappling exchange ending in submission, since I don’t especially respect what Lewis brings to the grappling exchange. \n\nThere’s a good chance that this ends up being a complete mess, however. But I’ll still take +200 into what I consider chaos manifest with solid confidence. \n\n### **Prediction:**\n\nOleynik body-shots into some sort of exotic club-sub R1 \n\n### **Recommended Bet:**\n\n2.5 units Oleynik @ +200\n\n(Max bet from Gugabe is 5 units)\n\n- - -\n\n## **Beneil Dariush vs Scott Holtzman**\n\nBoth of these fighters are ones that I value very highly, but I think that Dariush has reached a point in his career where he is profoundly fragile. Holtzman’s an aggressive, hard-hitting wrestleboxer who’ll get in his face and put up a hard-nosed pace. I don’t feel that’s a good recipe for Dariush, especially considering Dariush’ cardio seems to also be middling-at-best by this point in his career. \n\nI’m feeling the double-barrel play of ends ITD & Holtzmann Moneyline, just since I think Dariush is still very dangerous in the early going and Holtzmann is pretty damned hittable.  \n\n### **Prediction:**\n\nHoltzmann KO2\n\n### **Recommended Bet:**\n\n* 1.5 unit Ends Inside The Distance @ -105\n* 1 unit Holtzmann @ +130\n\n(Max bet from Gugabe is 5 units)\n\n- - -\n\n## **UFC Betting Guide**\n\nWant to learn how to win more with your UFC bets?\n\nRead our **[Ultimate Guide on UFC Betting](https://www.betrefinery.com/blog/bet-on-the-ufc/)**.",
