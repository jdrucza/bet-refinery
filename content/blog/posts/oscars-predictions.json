Like when Parasite was backed in hard on Oscar morning. \n\nSo make sure you return to the site as the event leads up. \n\nLet's check out the betting probabilities for the biggest awards:\n\n> * Best Picture\n> * Leading Actor\n> * Leading Actress\n> * Supporting Actor\n> * Supporting Actress\n\nPlus more.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Best Picture**\n\nNomadland won the Golden Globe, and has only got firmer in the market.\n\nIt's a dominant favorite. \n\nBut we remember when Parasite got backed off the map from 7-1, so we will be watching The Trial of the Chicago 7 and a few others in the field.\n\nBut Nomadland looks very hard to beat.\n\n<canvas id='g112' name=\"brgraph\" data-file-name=\"oscarsBestPicture.json\" data-only-names=\"Nomadland,The Trial of the Chicago 7,One Night In Miami,Mank,Minari,Promising Young Woman,Judas And The Black Messiah\" data-start=\"2021-02-26 00:00\" width=\"400\" height=\"150\"></canvas>\n\n- - -\n\n## **Leading Actor**\n\nChadwick Boseman is an overwhelming favorite. \n\nHis heart breaking fight with cancer and Golden Globe winning effort in Ma Rainey's Black Bottom makes him impossible to bet against. \n\nRiz Ahmed is the only other runner in the market.\n\n<canvas id='g111' name=\"brgraph\" data-file-name=\"oscarsLeadingActor.json\" data-only-names=\"Chadwick Boseman,Riz Ahmed\" data-start=\"2021-02-26 00:00\" width=\"400\" height=\"150\"></canvas>\n\n- - -\n\n## **Leading Actress**\n\nProbably the tightest market to watch. Could go multiple ways.\n\n<canvas id='g113' name=\"brgraph\" data-file-name=\"oscarsLeadingActress.json\" data-only-names=\"Viola Davis,Carey Mulligan,Frances McDormand,Andra Day,Vanessa Kirby\" data-start=\"2021-02-26 00:00\" width=\"400\" height=\"150\"></canvas>\n\n- - -\n\n## **Supporting Actor**\n\n<canvas id='g114' name=\"brgraph\" data-file-name=\"oscarsSupportingActor.json\" data-only-names=\"Sacha Baron Cohen,Leslie Odom Jr.,Daniel Kaluuya\" data-start=\"2021-02-26 00:00\" width=\"400\" height=\"150\"></canvas>\n\n- - -\n\n## **Supporting Actress**\n\nYuh-Jung Youn has been backed off the map. She wasn't in the market previously.\n\n<canvas id='g115' name=\"brgraph\" data-file-name=\"oscarsSupportingActress.json\" data-only-names=\"Glenn Close,Olivia Colman,Yuh-Jung Youn,Maria Bakalova\" data-start=\"2021-02-26 00:00\" width=\"400\" height=\"150\"></canvas>\n\n- - -\n\n## **Animated Feature**\n\n<canvas id='g132' name=\"brgraph\" data-file-name=\"oscarsAnimatedFeature.json\" data-only-names=\"Soul,Wolfwalkers,Shaun the Sheep:Farmageddon\" data-start=\"2021-04-04 00:00\" width=\"400\" height=\"150\"></canvas>\n\n- - -\n\n## **Best Director**\n\nChloe Zhao would have her script ready here.\n\n<canvas id='g133' name=\"brgraph\" data-file-name=\"oscarsBestDirector.json\" data-only-names=\"Chloe Zhao (Nomadland),David Fincher (Mank),Emerald Fennell(Promising Y.W),Lee Isaac Chung (Minari),Thomas Vinterberg(Another Rd.)\" data-start=\"2021-04-04 00:00\" width=\"400\" height=\"150\"></canvas>\n\n- - -\n\n## **Documentary Feature**\n\nHave only seen My Octopus Teacher here. Which got brilliant support from Netflix but didn't feel like an Icarus sized doco, despite the amazing cinematography. \n\n<canvas id='g134' name=\"brgraph\" data-file-name=\"oscarsDocumentaryFeature.json\" data-only-names=\"Time,Collective,My Octopus Teacher,Crip Cramp,The Mole Agent\" data-start=\"2021-04-04x 00:00\" width=\"400\" height=\"150\"></canvas>\n\n- - -\n\n# **Want entertainment predictions for all the other big events?
