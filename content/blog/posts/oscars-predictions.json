Like when Parasite was backed in hard on Oscar morning. \n\nSo make sure you return to the site as the event leads up. \n\nWe'll also expand our predictions from being data focused to having a more rounder opinion.\n\nFor now, let's check out the betting probabilities for the biggest awards:\n\n> * Best Picture\n> * Leading Actor\n> * Leading Actress\n> * Supporting Actor\n> * Supporting Actress\n\n- - -\n\n## **Best Picture**\n\nNomadland won the Golden Globe, and you can see the impact that had on the market.\n\nStill, at this stage, the market looks pretty open.\n\nWe're anticipating The Trial of the Chicago 7 to collect a few statues over the course of the night. Will it include Best Picture?\n\n<canvas id='g112' name=\"brgraph\" data-file-name=\"oscarsBestPicture.json\" data-only-names=\"Nomadland,The Trial of the Chicago 7,One Night In Miami,Mank,Minari,Promising Young Woman,Judas And The Black Messiah\" data-start=\"2021-02-26 00:00\" width=\"400\" height=\"150\"></canvas>\n\n- - -\n\n## **Leading Actor**\n\nChadwick Boseman is an overwhelming favorite. \n\nHis heart breaking fight with cancer and Golden Globe winning effort in Ma Rainey's Black Bottom makes him impossible to bet against. \n\nRiz Ahmed is the only other runner in the market.\n\n<canvas id='g111' name=\"brgraph\" data-file-name=\"oscarsLeadingActor.json\" data-only-names=\"Chadwick Boseman,Riz Ahmed\" data-start=\"2021-02-26 00:00\" width=\"400\" height=\"150\"></canvas>\n\n- - -\n\n## **Leading Actress**\n\nCarey Mulligan is the one to beat here but the market isn't dominant. Could be some late changes.\n\n<canvas id='g113' name=\"brgraph\" data-file-name=\"oscarsLeadingActress.json\" data-only-names=\"Viola Davis,Carey Mulligan,Frances McDormand,Michelle Pfeiffer\" data-start=\"2021-02-26 00:00\" width=\"400\" height=\"150\"></canvas>\n\n- - -\n\n## **Supporting Actor**\n\nWouldn't be shocked if Sacha won this. Could be betting with heart instead of head, but you gotta love Borat. The people's champion.\n\n<canvas id='g114' name=\"brgraph\" data-file-name=\"oscarsSupportingActor.json\" data-only-names=\"Sacha Baron Cohen,Leslie Odom Jr.,Daniel Kaluuya\" data-start=\"2021-02-26 00:00\" width=\"400\" height=\"150\"></canvas>\n\n- - -\n\n## **Supporting Actress**\n\nSome big names in a big field here. Glenn Close fav but plenty of competition.\n\n<canvas id='g115' name=\"brgraph\" data-file-name=\"oscarsSupportingActress.json\" data-only-names=\"Glenn Close,Jodie Foster,Olivia Colman,Ellen Burstyn\" data-start=\"2021-02-26 00:00\" width=\"400\" height=\"150\"></canvas>\n\n- - -",
