Like when Parasite was backed in hard on Oscar morning. \n\nSo make sure you return to the site as the event leads up. \n\nWe'll also expand our predictions from being data focused to having a more rounder opinion.\n\nFor now, let's check out the betting probabilities for the biggest awards:\n\n> * Best Picture\n> * Leading Actor\n> * Leading Actress\n> * Supporting Actor\n> * Supporting Actress\n\n- - -\n\n## **Best Picture**\n\nNomadland won the Golden Globe, and has only got firmer in the market.\n\nIt's a dominant favorite. \n\nBut we remember when Parasite got backed off the map from 7-1, so we will be watching The Trial of the Chicago 7 and a few others in the field.\n\nBut at the moment, Nomadland looks very hard to beat.\n\n<canvas id='g112' name=\"brgraph\" data-file-name=\"oscarsBestPicture.json\" data-only-names=\"Nomadland,The Trial of the Chicago 7,One Night In Miami,Mank,Minari,Promising Young Woman,Judas And The Black Messiah\" data-start=\"2021-02-26 00:00\" width=\"400\" height=\"150\"></canvas>\n\n- - -\n\n## **Leading Actor**\n\nChadwick Boseman is an overwhelming favorite. \n\nHis heart breaking fight with cancer and Golden Globe winning effort in Ma Rainey's Black Bottom makes him impossible to bet against. \n\nRiz Ahmed is the only other runner in the market.\n\n<canvas id='g111' name=\"brgraph\" data-file-name=\"oscarsLeadingActor.json\" data-only-names=\"Chadwick Boseman,Riz Ahmed\" data-start=\"2021-02-26 00:00\" width=\"400\" height=\"150\"></canvas>\n\n- - -\n\n## **Leading Actress**\n\nCarey Mulligan is the one to beat here but the market isn't dominant. Could be some late changes.\n\n<canvas id='g113' name=\"brgraph\" data-file-name=\"oscarsLeadingActress.json\" data-only-names=\"Viola Davis,Carey Mulligan,Frances McDormand,Andra Day,Vanessa Kirby\" data-start=\"2021-02-26 00:00\" width=\"400\" height=\"150\"></canvas>\n\n- - -\n\n## **Supporting Actor**\n\nWouldn't be shocked if Sacha won this. Could be betting with heart instead of head, but you gotta love Borat. The people's champion.\n\n<canvas id='g114' name=\"brgraph\" data-file-name=\"oscarsSupportingActor.json\" data-only-names=\"Sacha Baron Cohen,Leslie Odom Jr.,Daniel Kaluuya\" data-start=\"2021-02-26 00:00\" width=\"400\" height=\"150\"></canvas>\n\n- - -\n\n## **Supporting Actress**\n\nBetfair didn't even have Yuh-Jung Youn or Maria Bakalova in the early market. Now they're fighting for the Oscar.\n\nWho wins?\n\n<canvas id='g115' name=\"brgraph\" data-file-name=\"oscarsSupportingActress.json\" data-only-names=\"Glenn Close,Olivia Colman,Yuh-Jung Youn,Maria Bakalova\" data-start=\"2021-02-26 00:00\" width=\"400\" height=\"150\"></canvas>\n\n- - -",
