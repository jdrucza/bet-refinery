It’s one of our favourite sports to bet on and we’ll talk you through all the basics.\n\nWith some key tips to help you win more.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Horses For Courses**\n\nI’m not sure I ever understood the English proverb “Horses For Courses” until I started betting on golf.\n\nWhat it refers to is that some golfers suit different decks more than others. \n\nFor example, Bethpage Black requires driving distance. However, that’s worthless at Pebble Beach. You need a sharp short game. \n\nUnderstanding each course, and it’s unique features, will help you find the most suited golfers. Past history at the event is one indicator, but it isn’t your only guide. You can find tracks that play similarly. Spyglass Hill, for example, is really similar to Augusta.\n\nOne of the best free tools to get this insight is Data Golf.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Choose Your Variance**\n\nThe most popular market to bet on is who wins. Which is our favourite. But the variance is huge. You can go half a year or longer before finding a winner.\n\nBetween the PGA Tour and the Euro Tour (which we also bet on), there’s just over 90 tournaments per year. Plus you might find some LPGA or Senior events you want to bet on. \n\nWe’re talking 100 golf events per year. \n\nAnd some of the guys and girls that we believe are value bets can be +40000. The odds suggest they win every 400 tournaments. So those guys hit every four years for us.\n\nMy point is, there can be a lonnnnnnng time between winners if you’re exclusively betting on who wins a tournament. \n\nIn our eyes, variance is fine. As long as you have an edge and a bankroll. But those droughts can really test you. \n\nIf you want ego and bankroll boosts every few weeks,you might want to play in the other markets more frequently. \n\nThese include:\n\n* Head to Heads - two players, winner has the lowest score for the tournament\n* Miss or Make Cut - survive the cut after round two\n* Three Balls - which player will win the round against their two designated partners\n\n- - -\n\n## Best Free Betting Tools\n\n1. **PGA Tour Stats**\n\nIntimidating for newbies but the PGA Tour is incredibly transparent with data, which is all you can ask for as a sharp bettor. Driving Accuracy, Scrambling, GIR Putting, it’s all there.\n\n2. **Betfair UK Golf** \n\nSteven Rawlings is a legitimate pro bettor on golf. He’s been doing this a long time and his free insight warrants your attention. He’s got a great way of doing the historic form, finding the most suited players and backing them at good prices.\n\n3. **Data Golf**\n\nA popular golf betting resource, Data Golf is a cheap subscription service. Although there’s plenty of free information too. Rather than navigating the PGA Tour for all the answers, rookies can go straight to Data Golf. You’ll find rankings, trends and player vs course expectations. \n\n4. **Betfair Australia’s Golf Model**\n\nYou get calculated probabilities for every player and it compares those chances vs the Betfair market. Look for value.\nSimilar, though not as sophisticated, as our Golf Model, it gives you an extra prediction resource.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Futures Betting**\n\nOne sneaky trick that we love is betting on the four majors (plus the Players) a couple weeks out.\n\nFor example, we’ll watch the lead up tournaments to the Masters. If someone is crushing it in March, and they suit Augusta, we’ll back them at a great price before April is upon us.\n\nHow does that look?\nWell last year, Rory was on track to win the Players Championship. Before his final round we backed him for The Masters. We got +1900 and he started +1200 for The Masters.\n\nThe greatest, Tiger Woods, famously won the 2019 Masters. But it was a great bet and you won’t go broke finding opportunities like that.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Each Way All Day**\n\nDespite the rhyming heading, we never play the each way market. \n\nWhat it refers to is backing the same player to win as top 10. That way you can get a return if they play well but get beaten. \n\nHowever, we don’t love this option. We like to bet some guys to win, and other guys to place Top 10.\n\nFor example, Adam Scott didn’t win a tournament in 2019. However, he finished top 10 on 50% of his starts.\n\nMeanwhile, during the same season, Xander Schauffele only finished in the top 10 six times. But he won two PGA events.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Where To Bet**\n\nEvery sportsbook bets on golf, with dozens of side markets. \n\nJust make sure you shop around for odds. You’ll hear us say that repeatedly. \n\nIf you like a player on our model, or follow our tips, make sure you take the best odds on offer. Even if it means opening new accounts.\n\nIn fact, a golfer is ideal for a freebet.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Hedging a Bet in Golf**\n\nOne technique that you’ll often be tempted to take is the Cash Out offer from your sportsbook.\n\nYou back Justin Thomas at +1600 for $200 and he’s leading after 3 rounds. The sportsbook offers you $500 if you cash out early.\n\nWe resist the urge and ride the variance. But if you do want to hedge your action, consider the guys most likely to upset your ticket. \nWatch the last day of action and find other players to back in-play. The sportsbook margin will be less and you can set yourself up for stronger collects.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nYou now have all the tools to bet smarter on golf. Hopefully we've shown you that it's a sport you can win on too.\n\nRemember to return to Bet Refinery for our winning prediction model too.",
