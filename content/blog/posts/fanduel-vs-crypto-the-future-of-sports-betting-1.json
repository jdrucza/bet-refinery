  "body": "In this article, I'm going to share my predictions for the US sports betting market. \n\nSo what lense should we put on it?\n\nLet's do two time periods: \n\n* **2024 (when most US States are legal)**\n* **2028 (10 years since NJ legalised)**\n\nIn this article, I'm going to forecast the market share and trends for the US sports betting market.\n\nThink FanDuel vs DraftKings vs BetMGM vs Barstool etc.\n\nPlus we're also going to discuss the influence of some tech heavy exchanges.\n\nHave you heard of **Polymarket**, **Augur**, **Kalshi** or **Sporttrade** yet?\n\nLFG.\n\n- - -\n\n## **US Sports Betting Environment**\n\nFirstly. We know the States are broke AF. \n\nLike me with two kids and a wife with taste.\n\nCovid lockdowns and hurting small businesses, has helped **[Cuomo backflip in NY](https://www.si.com/gambling/2021/04/21/online-sports-betting-allowed-in-new-york)**. \n\n**[Florida are fasttracking their legalization and Arizona are nearly good to go](https://www.legalsportsreport.com/50949/sports-betting-news-april-26-2021/)**. With many more states to presumably follow.\n\nAnd Canada are **[getting in on the action](https://www.cbc.ca/sports/the-buzzer-newsletter-canada-legalizing-sports-betting-1.6000435)** too.\n\nOne place to follow all the legistlative action is the **[US Betting Report](https://usbettingreport.com/sports-betting/)**. \n\nPoint being. The $50 billion dollar sports betting gold rush is years ahead of where most of us thought it would be.\n\nWe can thank Wuhan. \n\nThat Chinese virus has helped sports betting companies more than 100 whale customers.\n\nJust check out the Flutter (FanDuel / Sportsbet in Australia / Paddy Power / Betfair) stock movement. \n\n~100% YoY:\n\n![flutter stock price](/images/uploads/flutter-stock.png \"flutter stock price\")\n\nOr make yourself real sick in the stomach and check out the PENN stock:\n\n![penn stock price](/images/uploads/penn-stock.png \"penn stock price\")\n\nPENN went Bitcoin!\n\nAnd similar to crypto, most analysts don't see sports betting slowing down.\n\nWe don't.\n\nAnd so let's check in on the current environment.\n\n- - -\n\n<div class=\"predictIt\">\n\nWant **the biggest promos?**\n\nStart with **$2,000** in bonus bets.\n\n**<a href=\"https://join.pointsbet.com/betrefinery-2rf/?utm_source=Unbounce_BetRefinery&utm_medium=Digital_Affiliate_CPA&utm_campaign=Risk_Free_2_500_1000_BetRefinery&utm_term=Unbounce&utm_content=BetRefinery&promo=REFINERY\">JOIN POINTSBET NOW!</a>**\n\n</div>\n\n- - -\n\n## **Current 2021 Competitors**\n\n**FanDuel** and **DraftKings** dominate. Arguably competing over 70%+ of the pie, with FanDuel winning.\n\n**PointsBet** were early movers but **BetMGM** and **Barstool** are your best bets for third pick. More on our predictions shortly.\n\nThen you've got the world champion, **Bet365**, and the Caesar's acquisition, **William Hill**.\n\nHills were actually on US soil first and are a huge brand in the UK, but they haven't made their presence felt yet.\n\nThen some much smaller Europeans in **Unibet/888 Sports** and **Tipico**.\n\nCanada is represented by **theScore** and there are some duplicate US brands like **FoxBet**. Plus whatever **Twinspires/Bet America** want to be called today.\n\nLike most oligopolies (a word I haven't used since year 12 economics), the big dogs eat most the food.\n\nAfter FanDuel and DraftKings, there might only be 30% on the table. And most of that is gobbled up by BetMGM, Barstool and PointsBet.\n\nNow that we've broadly shared the lay of the land, let's get predicting.\n\n- - -\n\n## **2024 Forecast**\n\nI'll make this simple and share my market share predictions.\n\nFanDuel will beat DraftKings.\n\nI bet on that buy buying Flutter on the UK stock market. \n\nFanDuel's parent company invented the current success formula. \n\nCreate a fun brand, spend insane cash on marketing, lure players with sign up offers and promotions, sponsor events and have betting markets on almost everything. Bet decent odds, but don't focus on price.\n\nIt's Flutter's business model. And to beat the man, you can't copy the man.\n\nSo I actually think the FanDuel lead over DraftKings will only get bigger, however DK will still maintain position two with that localised brand advantage.\n\nBetMGM, with a sh*t tonne of cash from the US and UK, will compete hard for the third spot.\n\nBut I'm putting my chips on Davey Portnoy and co. They have an enormous database of perfect customers. Recreational mugs who bet for fun. And Barstool has the brand.\n\nUnless the Penn product sucks (which is possible with Kambi providing the tech), I see them just beating BetMGM.\n\nPointsBet, will be a distant fifth. \n\nA stab at the market share in 2024 would be:\n\n* FanDuel 35%\n* DraftKings 26%\n* Barstool 11%\n* BetMGM 10%\n* PointsBet 6%\n* Bet365 4%\n* William Hill 2%\n\nThe rest will have crumbs.\n\nNow, where I get really excited is the non-direct competitors.\n\n- - -\n\n## **New Competitors**\n\nHave you heard of **[PredictIt](https://www.predictit.org/)?** \n\nThe clever NZ based company that got permission to bet on Political markets. Including Trump vs Biden. Where they traded millions but had embarrassing tech issues on Election Day 2020.\n\nPredictIt got in first but they limit the size of your bets (due to their license) and charge woeful fees. Like 10%. Which is insane.\n\nSo who is going to wipe them out?\n\n**[Polymarket](https://polymarket.com/), [Kalshi](https://kalshi.com/)** or **[Augur](https://augur.net/)**. \n\nI'm farking amped about Polymarket.\n\nThe investors are none other than Naval and Balaji. \n\nSingle name celebrities. Like Madonna. But richer.\n\nIt's a current event betting exchange built on Ethereum. You can read more about them **[HERE](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rorymurray/2020/10/19/polymarket-raises-massive-4-million-round-from-polychain-naval-ravikant-other-notable-investors/?sh=6bb467bcc62e)**. \n\nAugur actually pioneered this space but I just don't see them taking advantage of their headstart. \n\nI'll log in now and there are seven weak markets with no liquidity:\n\n![augur markets](/images/uploads/augur.png \"augur markets\")\n\nMy hypothesis is that their business leaders are involved in so many exciting projects, they aren't piloting to Augur to Mars.\n\nSo **I'm betting Polymarket head to head** **there**, despite starting years later.\n\nKalshi, is the other exchange to Google.\n\nTheir trading concept is very similar to these guys (politics, entertainment, current affairs). Only it's not crypto, and therefore less confrotning right now.\n\nGetting legal permission to trade these markets is very hard, and speaks to how many rich, smart people are supporting them.\n\nI'm betting on Kalshi long too. However, as a crypto loving gambler, I'd rather be on Polymarket.\n\n### **How does this effect sports betting?**\n\nWell, hopefully both organisations realize that there is a lot of money on the table when you let people trade SuperBowls and March Madness finals. There is cash in political markets too, but the sporting schedule provides daily cashflow. And importantly, additional market segments.\n\nAnother one to check out in the exchange space is **[Sporttrade](https://getsporttrade.com/)**. \n\nBased in Philly and Jersey, they're trying to be the first sports betting exchange in the US. A very challenging nut to crack, but one to watch.\n\nLastly, I alwasy keep an eye on **[Jason Trost](https://profiles.forbes.com/members/business/profile/Jason-Trost-CEO-Founder-Smarkets/5cc7f6ab-0825-4c55-8322-888541502cf9)**. The American entrepreneur runs the UK based Smarkets and SBK sportsbook. \n\nHe could also revolutionise the exchange model in the US, or provide the best prices in the industry. Like an onshore, legal **[Pinnacle](https://www.pinnacle.com/en/)**.\n\nBut his European focus has me prefer some other players right now.\n\n- - -\n\n## **2028 Forecast**\n\nSeven years is a long time in sports betting. Especially if the last two to three in the US teach us anything.\n\nNot to mention the crypto markets, which have enormous appeal to the sophisticated players that all the legal sportsbooks will ban.\n\nPlus I'm super optimistic about the crypto influence on every industry today. No more so than sports betting.\n\nSo it's really hard to forecast where the crossover occurs in seven years, but I'll have a crack.\n\nFirstly, there will be massive colidation.\n\nPointsBet will absolutely get bought out and so will every small joint. Including theScore.\n\nThe sportsbook market in 2028:\n\n* **FanDuel 35%**\n* **DraftKings 22%**\n* **Barstool 15%**\n* **BetMGM 13%**\n* **Bet365 6%**\n\nThe exchange market in 2028:\n\n* **Polymarket 60%**\n* **Kalshi 25%**\n* **Augur 10%**\n* **Sportstrade 5%**\n\n- - -\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nIf you're as bullish as I am about sports betting, one way to capitalise is by buying the ETF **BETZ**. It exposes you to both operators and suppliers and keeps trending upwards.\n\nI'd also encourage you to **bet hard on FLUTTER** long term (UK stock market).\n\nThey just dominate every market they operate in and their economies of scale and marketing experience will win out.\n\nLastly, I just buy ETH. I know Ethereum is at an all time high but I'm confident it is hitting 10K USD in the next twelve months. Too many successful businesses, like NBA Topshot, advocate for it.\n\nAnd **Polymarket** is just one of 100 other crypto tech companies with unicorn potential, that take advantage of it.\n\n\\* this is not financial advice. I am a farking gambler. But.... Bet The Fark Up.\n\nThe first Bet Refinery merchandise will be trademarking \"BTFU\".\n\n- - -\n\n<div class=\"predictIt\">\n\nWant **the biggest promos?**\n\nStart with **$2,000** in bonus bets.\n\n**<a href=\"https://join.pointsbet.com/betrefinery-2rf/?utm_source=Unbounce_BetRefinery&utm_medium=Digital_Affiliate_CPA&utm_campaign=Risk_Free_2_500_1000_BetRefinery&utm_term=Unbounce&utm_content=BetRefinery&promo=REFINERY\">JOIN POINTSBET NOW!</a>**\n\n</div>\n\n- - -\n\n## **Want more industry insight?
