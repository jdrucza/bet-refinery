  "body": "Firstly, before we get into the scoring, rules and cool videos. \n\nIf you just want expert betting advice from someone that professionally lives off their AFL bets, go HERE. \n\nEach week we share three spread bets. Last year, our man won at 13%. \n\nAnd he’s been winning for ten years. It’s insane that we can share his picks for free.\n\n## **Why Is The Guy Anonymous?**\n\nBecause he works for a sportsbook in Australia and he would lose his job.\nEnough said.\n\nBack to the betting guide.\n\n## **What Is AFL?**\n\nThe Australian Football League (AFL) is the most popular sport in Australia. It’s known internationally as Aussie Rules. Locally, it’s called ‘footy’.\n\nIf we listed everything thing you need to know, this post would like a Wikipedia page on AFL. \n\nBut if you want the simplest solution, here’s our description:\n\nYou win by kicking goals. Which means kicking the oval shaped ball through the two middle sticks.\n\nYou get 6 points for that. \n\n1 point if it just misses. \n\nFor a well shot video, that goes into more detail, watch this:\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XMZYZcoAcU0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## **Betting On Footy**\n\nAs you may already know, Australians are known for a few things. These include, but aren’t limited, to:\n\n* Loving alcohol\n* Loving to travel\n* Loving to gamble\n* Loving to watch sport\n* Loving to gamble on sport while drinking alcohol, in a foreign country and trying to get laid\n\nWe bet on most things, but we love betting on football. Any football. NFL, EPL, NRL (rugby), Champions League. \n\nWe’ll bet on your social, mixed, indoor soccer.\n\nIf it’s not already evident, we love to bet on the AFL. \n\n## **How To Bet On The AFL**\n\nWell, in the US, the games are offered by all the big sportsbooks. Moneyline, spread, total, it's all there. \n\nFanduel, owned by Flutter, has a sister business in Aystralia called Sportsbet. They use all the same software, so you should find the most markets there.\n\nBut as always, it pays to shop around. Make sure you’re getting top odds as that will really impact your long term success.\n\n## **Betting Strategies**\n\nShould you bet favourites, dogs, totals, spreads? Well, there’s no right or wrong answer there. \n\nPros love to bet totals because the markets aren’t very efficient but smart bettors can win on all of it. Even props.\n\n## **Bet Refinery Assistance**\n\nAs we mentioned at the top of the guide, we have an expert form analyst who wins really well on AFL. If you copy his action all season, you should be very happy.\n\nWe’re also developing an AFL prediction model and will share those outputs every week.\n\nOne of our co-founders, Jason, has made a fortune betting on AFL. He’s one of the best betting data scientists in the world and he’ll be sharing his model after has does a few other betting models.\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nAFL is an incredible sport. It’s high scoring, exciting and perfect for betting. Plus, we’ve got an expert bettor sharing his winning tips every week. Just follow him in.\n\nThe timezone isn’t ideal but you should get games to watch on ESPN on Friday and Saturday night. But you don’t need to watch it to make a profit. Follow our man and stay tuned for our exclusive Prediction Model. With those two resources, AFL might become your favorite sport.",
