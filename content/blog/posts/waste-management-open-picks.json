  "body": "The fun returns to Phoenix, so we're firing up the Golf Model for **Waste Management Open picks**.\n\nBefore that though, where does the Phoenix Open sit on your bucket list?\n\nFor me, it's top five golf tournaments of the year. Love me some day drinking in the desert.\n\nNot quite the same in Covid-21 but hopefully theres some anarchy and atmosphere with the much smaller crowd.\n\nAnyway, let's run the numbers and see who stands out.\n\n- - -\n\n## **2021 Waste Management Open Outputs**\n\n<div name=\"brtable\" data-file-name=\"tournamentPredictionsWasteManagement.json\" height=\"400px\"></div>\n\nNext step is comparing these outputs vs the market. \n\nUntil our odds comparison is ready, we use **[Odds Boom](https://www.oddsboom.com/golf/futures/2247-phoenix-open/)**.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Final Waste Management Open Picks**\n\nAs you can see, the Model is almos bang on with the market. \n\nLargely, the same 10 players in order.\n\nHard to bet when you can't spot an edge.\n\nHowever, as the title suggests, **Louis Oosthuizen** is value.\n\nThe Model says he's the 13th best player in the field, on current form. But you can get 66-1 with our friends at PointsBet. \n\nIf you're real itchy for a bet and love **Will Zalatoris**, he's also just value vs the market. Again, PointsBet have the best odds. \n\nBut we'll give young William space this week and have a few crumbs on **The Kuch**.\n\nHe paid out worse than a slot machine in 2020 but we trust in the Model. And the Model always sees things in Matt Kuchar. Beyond his sh*tty caddy tipping.\n\nSo that's it for the winners market. We strongly encourage you to go through all the outputs and pick off some tournament matchups with the lesser knowns.\n\n### **Final Picks**\n\n* **1 unit Louis Oosthuizen at 66-1 with [Pointsbet](https://join.pointsbet.com/betrefinery-2rf/?utm_source=Unbounce_BetRefinery&utm_medium=Digital_Affiliate_CPA&utm_campaign=Risk_Free_2_500_1000_BetRefinery&utm_term=Unbounce&utm_content=BetRefinery&promo=REFINERY)**\n* **0.3 units on Matt Kuchar at 66-1 with [Pointsbet ](https://join.pointsbet.com/betrefinery-2rf/?utm_source=Unbounce_BetRefinery&utm_medium=Digital_Affiliate_CPA&utm_campaign=Risk_Free_2_500_1000_BetRefinery&utm_term=Unbounce&utm_content=BetRefinery&promo=REFINERY)/ FanDuel / DraftKings / Unibet**\n\n- - -\n\n<div class=\"predictIt\">\n\n**<a href=\"http://join.pointsbet.com/betrefinery-2rf/?utm_source=Unbounce_BetRefinery&utm_medium=Digital_Affiliate_CPA&utm_campaign=Risk_Free_2_500_1000_BetRefinery&utm_term=Unbounce&utm_content=BetRefinery&promo=REFINERY\" target=\"_blank\">WANT GREAT GOLF ODDS?

He makes a healthy living by betting off his sports models. \n\nHis most recent, our golf model, uses the last 15 years of data to produce win predictions for PGA tournaments. The model can be broken down into three stages:\n\n1. **Historic score adjustment** \n\n   Firstly, historic golf scores are adjusted to account for varying course difficulty and conditions on the day. For example a \"-2\" on a certain course/day combination may be an average score but on another course/day combination it might be a great score due to the course being more difficult and/or unfavorable conditions. This adjustment is necessary so that we can compare players on a like for like basis.\n2. **Score prediction** \n\n   We then create features using the adjusted historic scores and run a few machine learning algorithms on top of these, weighting each equally. These provide an accurate prediction for the most likely score that a player will achieve on an average course in the future.\n3. **Simulation**\n\n   Using these future score predictions, for a given tournament we can then simulate each player's score using their own score distribution to come up with win percentages and fair odds for each player in a tournament.\n\n- - -\n\n## **More Golf Betting Expertise**\n\nIf you love betting on golf like us, check out our **[Top 50 World Golf Rankings](https://www.betrefinery.com/golf-betting/world-golf-rankings)**.
