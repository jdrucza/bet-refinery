We’ll discuss the betting options, as well as hear from a professional UFC bettor.\n\n### **So Why is UFC Betting Opportune?**\n\nBecause the markets aren’t efficient yet The UFC is a relatively new betting sport (betting started in the Tito Ortiz days, not the Royce Gracie days)\nSportsbooks, like Fanduel and DraftKings, are new to it too\nThis inexperience on both sides means the markets aren’t efficient yet\nIt’s not a stat heavy sport with sophisticated models shaping the odds\n- - -\n\n### How To Bet On UFC Matches\n\nThis will depend on where you live.  In most developed countries around the world, you’ll be able to find a betting app that would love to have you. \nIn the US, you’ll need to live in a state where sports betting is legal.\n\nAssuming you can, you won’t have trouble finding the next UFC event. The whole fight card will be listed.  The main event and primary undercard fights will be available months in advance. The early prelims might appear several weeks out.\n- - -\n\n## Betting Options\n\n### Moneyline\n\n80%+ of the turnover will be on the moneyline.  Thats where it lists the fighter and has a +number or a -number.\nFor example\nKhabib Nurmagomedov -225\nJustin Gaethje +190\n\nThat means you need to wager $225 on Khabib to win $100. Or every $100 bet you make on Gaethje will win you $190.\n\nAnd moneyline betting just means you have to win. Submission, decision, KO, doesn’t matter.\n- - -\n\n### Method of Victory\n\nIn this popular market there’s three options per fighter. KO/TKO, Points (decision) or Submission. Plus the draw. \n\nThis is a great way to get some extra value on your bet if the sportsbook underrated their skillset. For example, a renowned knockout artist might have submission odds of +1100, but you know their jiu-jitsu is strong and they have the matchup advantage on the ground.\n- - -\n\n### How Will The Fight End?\n\nSimilar to Method Of Victory except you don’t have to side with a fighter. You simple choose from KO/TKO, Decision and Submission.  So if you’re confident the fight will last the distance, you can bet on Decision. You’ll get paid no matter who raises their hand.\n\n### Will The Fight Go The Distance?\n\nAnother simple one that doesn’t require explanation.  This is a market we focus on when powerful heavyweights meet in the octagon, especially in non title (three round) fights. The market expects a KO and you can sometimes find value in choosing No.\n- - -\n\n### Total Rounds\n\nOver / Under markets are popular in every other sport so sportsbooks sensibly bet on them here. However, they warrant some discussion and we recommend you check the rules at your sportsbook, just in case their interpretation varies.\n\nThat said, this example should apply to your sportsbook’s rules. If the Over / Under is set at 2.5 in a title fight, and you bet the Unders, you need the fight to finish before the 2 minute and 30-second mark of the third round.\n\nIt does not matter if it’s by submission or KO or TKO; as long as the fight finishes before that mark, you win your bet. If you bet the over on 2.5 rounds, you need the fight to last at least one second past the 2 minutes and 30-second mark of the third round.\n- - -\n\n## How To Win\n\nNow that we’ve covered the basics, we’re going to show you some strategies for winning.\n\nFirstly, unless you’re Nostradameus, don’t try to parlay the whole card. Your 10 leg parlay might show a big number on the bet slip but it ain’t hitting. Keep your parlays to three legs or less, so that you can shop for the best odds.\n- - -\n\n### Moneyline Shopping\n\nWhen you need new headphones, do you just buy whatever price Amazon is offering? Or do you compare Best Buy and Beats By Dre too?  What about when you’re flying cross country? Are you going to American Airlines regardless of price or Kayak first?\n\nYou get the point.\n\nOdds are everything. And winning at UFC betting in the long term isn’t about picking the right fighters, believe",
