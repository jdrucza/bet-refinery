Developed by one of the best sports betting data scientists in the world.\n\nWebb Simpson, one of our disappointing green jacket bets is at the top of the market. \n\nClear favourite.\n\nBut he looks slightly under the odds of sportsbooks. \n\nMeaning he isn't value.\n\nAnd we shop for value. \n\nSo let's pack the kids in the minivan, head to Walmart, and hunt for value.\n\n- - -\n\n## **2020 RSM Classic Outputs**\n\nHere are the outputs from our Model. Details on how it was built are down the bottom of the page.\n\n<div name=\"brtable\" data-file-name=\"tournamentPredictionsRSM.json\" height=\"400px\"></div>\n\nNow, the next step is comparing these outputs vs the market. \n\nUntil our odds comparison is ready, we use **[Odds Checker](https://www.oddschecker.com/us/golf/the-rsm-classic/winner)**. \n\n- - -\n\n## **RSM Classic Picks**\n\nAs the title suggests, we found some value in two familiar names.\n\n**Louis Oosthuizen** and **Matt Kuchar**.\n\nYou can get 33-1 and 80-1 respectively.\n\nThe model thinks both players have a greater chance of winning than the sportsbooks' odds suggest. So there's value in betting them baby.\n\nWe're also backing **Ian Poulter**. \n\nWe have a soft spot for the Englishman and the model gives him a marginally better shot at winning than FanDuel and Pointsbet do.\n\nSo we've got:\n\n* **1.5 units on Louis Oosthuizen** at 33-1 with Pointsbet \n* **0.7 units on Ian Poulter** at 60-1 with Pointsbet\n* **0.5 units on Matt Kuchar** at 80-1 with Pointsbet\n\n1 unit for us is $100.\n\n- - -\n\n<div class=\"predictIt\">\n\n**<a href=\"http://join.pointsbet.com/betrefinery-2rf/?utm_source=Unbounce_BetRefinery&utm_medium=Digital_Affiliate_CPA&utm_campaign=Risk_Free_2_500_1000_BetRefinery&utm_term=Unbounce&utm_content=BetRefinery&promo=REFINERY\" target=\"_blank\">WANT GREAT GOLF ODDS?

He makes a healthy living by betting off his sports models. \n\nHis most recent, our golf model, uses the last 15 years of data to produce win predictions for PGA tournaments. The model can be broken down into three stages:\n\n1. **Historic score adjustment** \n\n   Firstly, historic golf scores are adjusted to account for varying course difficulty and conditions on the day. For example a \"-2\" on a certain course/day combination may be an average score but on another course/day combination it might be a great score due to the course being more difficult and/or unfavorable conditions. This adjustment is necessary so that we can compare players on a like for like basis.\n2. **Score prediction** \n\n   We then create features using the adjusted historic scores and run a few machine learning algorithms on top of these, weighting each equally. These provide an accurate prediction for the most likely score that a player will achieve on an average course in the future.\n3. **Simulation**\n\n   Using these future score predictions, for a given tournament we can then simulate each player's score using their own score distribution to come up with win percentages and fair odds for each player in a tournament.\n\n- - -\n\n## **More Golf Betting Expertise**\n\nIf you love betting on golf like us, check out our **[Top 50 World Golf Rankings](https://www.betrefinery.com/golf-betting/world-golf-rankings)**.
