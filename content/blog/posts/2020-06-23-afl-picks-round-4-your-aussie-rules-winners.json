  "body": "Your expert AFL Picks are back. And the great man is on fire. \n\n5 from 6 since the season resume. Both teams that he liked at the plus, Carlton and Sydney, won. What a result, especially Blues backers. \n\nThis week he sticks with the Swans and jumps back on the Kangaroos.\n\n# **AFL ROUND 4 Picks**\n\n## **Sydney v Western Bulldogs**\n\nThe Swans are tremendous plays as outsiders in this spot. They have covered 10 of their last 12 as an underdog including twice this season. Off a win as an underdog, the Swans are 17-9 against the spread since 2012. The Bulldogs are poor favourites, covering at just 41%. \n\nThe Bulldogs have covered just two of their last 12 interstate games. Happy to stick with the reliable Swans here. \n\n## **Recommended Bet:**\n\nSydney +3.5\n\n## **Stars To Watch:**\n\nLuke Parker #26 for Sydney\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oY2z5SPEY_Y\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n- - -\n\n## **GWS v Collingwood**\n\nCollingwood are good travellers and that puts them in a nice spot on the road to a GWS team that is flailing since the season resumption. The Magpies are 22-11 against the spread interstate and were arguably the most impressive team of Round 3. The Giants have been hit hard by injury. \n\nCollingwood have covered six of nine against GWS. \n\n## **Recommended Bet:**\n\nCollingwood -6.5\n\n## **Stars To Watch:**\n\nJeremy Howe #38 for Collingwood\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8-OPoCGyDPo\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n- - -\n\n## Hawthorn v North Melbourne\n\nNorth Melbourne are 47-31 ATS as an underdog or more than a goal since 2012 and are perennially underrated by the market. At Marvel Stadium in the spot they cover at a remarkable 74%. \n\nHawthorn have covered just two of their last seven as a favourite off a win. Good spot for the Roos here. \n\n## Recommended Bet: \n\nNorth Melbourne +7.5\n\n## **Stars To Watch:**\n\nShaun Higgings #4 for North Melbourne\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5hOal10U7oA\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>",
