Bonus bets. Sign up offers.\n\nYou get a free shot to turn sportsbook money into your money.\n\nBut you don’t get the stake back.\n\nSo how do you use them? \n\nWe’ll go into all the gruesome details. \n\nBy the end of this article, you’ll be a bonus bet boss.\n\nContents:\n\n1. Maximise Your Bonus Bets\n2. Know The Rules\n3. How To Use Them\n4. How To Win No Matter The Result\n5. WTF is Gubbing & What Are Promo Arbers?\n6. Conclusion\n\n- - -\n\n## **1. How To Maximise Your Bonus Bets**\n\nYou’ll see this recommendation over and over from us.\nYou need multiple sportsbook accounts.\nIt allows you to shop for the best odds. Which is super important if you want to improve your sportsbook P & L.\n\nSecondly, by being a sportsbook sl&t, you can milk multiple sign up offers.\n\nSportsbooks offer $200-$1,500 bonus bets for new customers.\n\nIf you’re in a legal sportsbook state, and have access to a dozen sportsbooks, that’s serious cash.\n\nPlus you can access the best weekly promotions from each sportsbook.\n\n- - -\n\n## **2. Know The Rules**\n\nFirst of all. \n\nYou don’t get the stake back in your account after the bet. \n\nSo backing anything less than +100 is just a waste of time.\n\n$500 free bet at -500 is:\n\n($500 x -500) - $500 = $100\n\nYou don’t pocket the $500 bonus bet and the $100 profit if you win. \n\nYou keep $100.\n\nThat’s like getting the chance to win a car if you hit a homerun and you decide to bunt it for a box of popcorn.\n\nSwing for the fences! \n\nBut DO NOT parlay. There’s too much vig. Straight out bets only.\n\nThe other piece of key information is to know the terms and conditions of the bonus bet.\n\nIf you win, can you withdraw it immediately? \n\nThat’s what a high quality sportsbook allows. \n\nA cowboy sportsbook, like those overshore, make you bet the winnings like three, four or five times. The higher the turnover requirement, the more likely the sportsbook is run by degenerates. And we’re not talking about HHH and Shawn Michaels. Maybe Chyna.\n\nIf you do have to turn over your winnings, make sure you do it on the shortest odds possible. But find a real sure thing. You can email us and we’ll pick something out, just for you and the sportsbook you’re taking on.\n\n- - -\n\n## **3. How To Use Them (Like A Pro)**\n\nTwo sharp professional sports bettors that collect bonus bets like Pokemon, have a strict rule:\n\n“Nothing under +400.”\n\n(+400 is 4-1 or $5, depending on your location)\n\n“The value isn’t there.”\n\nSo it must be +400 or greater.\n\nBut no four leg parlays. They have too much vig.\n\nFor example, if you have a $500 bonus bet, find an NFL team at the moneyline. A big outsider.\n\nOr a UFC fighter.\n\nPersonally, I love futures. You could have got the Lakers at +400 or bigger for most of last season.\n\nPatience is a virtue though and I know most bettors just want to hit it and quit it.\n\n- - -\n\n## **4. How To Win No Matter What**\n\nConsistent with the advice above, you can turn that bonus bet into cash. No matter who wins the game.\n\nFor example, we’ve scrolled through FanDuel to find a moneyline at +400 or better.\n\nCollege football it is:\n\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/PPlnbSJbPfRYsTklTzV2jd_dgYEZAYIzNozBWJbUdNik1CHpBKAoEpcot0VtkVp0XYWt20bhb49opMp78ElZaFhbITfCEtrLtxc0bQ1jDGJ8KaDYVssZ1WpXByIk6zzLpTtsG0b1)\n\nWe’re going to have our $500 free bet on Northern Illinois at +440.\n\nBut we want to back Ball State as well.\n\nWe could do it at FanDuel as well. But the vig, using [this calculator](https://www.sportsbookscout.com/tools/vig-calculator), is 5.2%.\n\n![vig calculator](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ckIWLZ3aslZd7tRaYt94O-x0w6jzkwDWtM4hcEIvuyzuSPDwQgP0G-sOuJrSsRlC5A-jV5ghFwpxFL4tYFxUuMxPdq-L8t0tQgP_reiUg9_FIaEmKC0C45zf_y39u9KpXd7PFjyq \"vig calculator\")\n\nSo we’ll use [OddsChecker](https://www.oddschecker.com/us/football) to find the same game and shop for odds.\n\n![oddschecker](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/bzHRjkERHx2gjJYc74re5s8CpiXcINzXXiog3YaM8mrE9ZM-rkHbqDxtT4J6kxNc1htInhTtB81T_zO9ZxYUer5zHUz98bF3fr5C-HI7Q_5Gaqzkgymo1vnF1tnQ9JblVY0tpcDT \"oddschecker\")\n\nIt’s tough to read our screenshot but FoxBet is -500.\n\nThat brings our vig down to a delicious 1.85%. \n\n![vig calculator](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Tw08g_rNIl31l4irkGrBx96vLF1zYZxlAGEi7dRYX3oOGFr8FzoptmX48E9rdwknMa0O0ydrQUaDv9mZmTUBMeW3kMMVETciCPcIPQMA-eXVfYi6k8_UKPjgT1nyZa_vyuEVudp1 \"vig calculator\")\n\nNow we need to do the maths on how much to have on Ball State at -500.\n\nThis is the [best calculator](http://www.beatingbonuses.com/calc_matched.htm) we’ve found while we develop our own.\n\nYou need to select:\n\n* SNR (which stands for betting Stake Not Returned)\n* Back Odds: US\n* 2nd Bet Type: Back\n* Back2 Odds: US\n* Bet Size: 500\n* Back Odds of the free bet is +440\n* Back2 Odds of Ball State is -500.\n* Calculate\n\n![bonus bet calculator](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/NTuX68toP30Dnj7ZPbF_6NXFDpwssAqc81fABZWRyo-l0xa7UHNwQZ-LRDZ2DpesMt8pNONbdaR7279ptjZarSBkLTVULSwPvj-2ocu80lPE3Nf7LYJPB0nbfzuhDbZjbXipzkDG \"bonus bet calculator\")\n\nSo that tells you to have:\n\n* Your $500 free bet with FanDuel on Northern Illinois at +440.\n* Then have $1,833.33 with FoxBet on Ball State at -500.\n\nNo matter the result of the game, you win $366.67.\n\nThat is what they call “matched betting”. \n\n- - -\n\n## **5. WTF Is Gubbing & Who Are Promo Arbers**\n\nA promo arber, or matched bettor, is someone that exclusively bets on sportsbook promotions. \n\nI call them promo rorters.\n\nThere’s serious cash to be made but sportsbooks will notice your doggish behaviour and remove promotions from your account.\n\nThat is what matched bettors call “gubbing”.\n\nI don’t know why but I farking hate that term.\n\nI just call it promo banned. \n\n### **Our advice?**\n\nEnjoy the big sign up offers. Go hard. You only get them once.\n\nEnjoy the weekly promos that are relevant to your betting.\n\nBut don’t use them exclusively, or you’ll lose them.\n\n- - -\n\n## **6. Conclusion**\n\nBonus bets are a big part of the sportsbook experience.\n\nMake sure you use them to their capacity. \n\nFind odds that are +400 or better. It’s up to you if you want to back the other side and lay off the risk.\n\nJust make sure that any bet you place is at the top price. Comparing odds is key to your success.\n\nMaximise the amount of sign up offers available in your state too. Go hard.\n\nGot any other questions you want to ask our team?
