  "body": "With Selection Sunday released, **March Madness 2021** is here.\n\nNow we fill out our bracket. Then edit it. And edit again.\n\nAnd we bet. Every day for three weeks (although that's normal here).\n\nThis article will help you with both your bracketology and your betting.\n\nOne of our co-founders has been betting professionally for nearly 20 years and he shares the predictions from his exclusive Model.\n\nWith that winning Model, we can help you:\n\n* **Predict the Final Four**\n* **Predict the NCAA Winner**\n* Win on **Player Props** throughout\n* **Spot the upsets**\n\nDon't be one of those muppets that just puts every 1 and 2 seed through, including them on your moneyline parlays each day. You know that strategy will result in heartache.\n\nYou need to find value when you bet and don't follow the favorites blindly.\n\nUse our Model. It even includes player point predictions for every team!\n\nBookmark this motherfarker so you can win in March: **[Free NCAAB Picks](https://www.betrefinery.com/ncaab-betting/free-ncaab-picks)**\n\nAlso, take a look at our rankings of the **[Best Player in College Basketball](https://www.betrefinery.com/ncaab-betting/best-players-in-college-basketball)**, you won't find Cade at the top.\n\n- - -\n\n## **March Madness 2021 Team Rankings**\n\nLet's get straight into the secret sauce.\n\nOur winning NCAAB Model ranks every team. You will not find a better resource. Anywhere.\n\nThe Rating is how much better each team is compared to an average team which a rating of 0.\n\nFor example, Gonzaga is 25 points better than every team that didn't make the Tournament. And they are 5+ points better than the other top teams, which is dominant.\n\nSo use the Rating when comparing teams. It's much better than the Tournament rankings or anything you'll find on ESPN or the AP.\n\n<div name=\"brtable\" data-api-name=\"ncaab_ratings\"></div>\n\n- - -\n\n<!--Please note that changes to this code are not permitted.

And let's run through each region.\n\n## **West Predictions**\n\nOn face value, the West looks tough.\n\nFour top 10 ranked teams is the same region:\n\n* **Gonzaga**\n* **Iowa**\n* **Virginia**\n* **Kansas**\n\nThat's nasty. And the Zags are likely going to have to beat two of them just to make the Final Four.\n\nHowever, their Rating is just incredible. \n\nA score of 25.42 means they are 8 points better than Iowa and nearly 10 points more than Virginia. Who we think'll run into.\n\nWe're expecting they'll get a real scare, but they will prevail.\n\nHere's our bracket for the West. Probably a little too predictable, but we've filled out using the Model's Ratings for each content.\n\n![march madness predictions - west region](/images/uploads/west-region-bracket.png \"march madness predictions - west region\")\n\n### **Final Four From The West**\n\nThere is no point taking Gonzaga to get through at -227 ($1.40). You might get them -227 during one of the games if they find themselves down at half time. \n\nYou're better off backing them game by game or just outright at +250.\n\nDespite the short odds, the Zags will be getting through to the Final Four.\n\n- - -\n\n## **South Predictions**\n\nThose Bears of Baylor have been humbled recently and lost significant ground on Gonzaga. But they are just holding off Illinois as the number two team on our rankings.\n\nThey are still the comprehensive favorites to win the South, but this region features seven of the top 20 teams:\n\n* **Baylor**\n* **North Carolina**\n* **Texas Tech**\n* **Villanova**\n* **Ohio State**\n* **Wisconsin**\n* **Arkansas**\n\nPlus **Purdue** and **Florida** are only a few points worse.\n\nBaylor will get an early challenge in the Round of 32 with UNC and Wisconsin looking tough 8/9 seeds. UNC is a top 10 team!\n\nIf they survive that, it's probably Villanova or Purdue. They should do it, but the Bear fights start early.\n\nOn the other side, we love Texas Tech, Ohio State or Arkansas to get through. The Model rates them all similarly. \n\n![march madness south region](/images/uploads/souht-region-march-madness.png \"march madness south region\")\n\n### **Final Four From The South**\n\n\\-125 looks very skinny for Baylor too. Steer clear.\n\nSame as Gonzaga, you might get some good live prices and live handicaps if they face an early fight.\n\nWhat we mean by that, is if Baylor get down 10+ points, you can bet on them at inflated odds during the game to overcome the adversity. They have the offense to rain buckets.\n\nThe best value to make the Final Four is Texas Tech (7-1), Arkansas (8-1) and UNC (15-1). \n\nNo one is talking about Carolina but the boys in baby blue can cause some upsets with no pressure on them.\n\n- - -\n\n## **East Predictions**\n\nWe don't love **Michigan**. \n\nThey are the weakest #1, so we're going to try find the spot they lose.\n\nIt could very much be the Round of 32. LSU, who lost to 'Bama by 1 point in the SEC Final, are the fourth best offensive team in the country. \n\nWe'll be backing LSU at the money and the plus.\n\nShould the Wolverines get through, they'll probably meet Alabama in the Elite 8. \n\nThere really isn't much depth to the East and we can't see deep runs from Texas, Colorado or Florida State.\n\n**Alabama** looks to have a soft run, with perhaps only BYU taking it to them.\n\nAll in all, as much as we don't love Michigan, this the weakest region. \n\n### **Final Four From The East**\n\n**Alabama at +450** is the bet for us.\n\nTheir D leaves a lot to be desired but the third best offense in the country can blast their way to the FInal Four.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Midwest Predictions**\n\n**Illinois** are right behind Baylor as the third best team in the country. Ayo Dosunmu is no joke and Kofi Cockburn just outplayed Luka Garza.\n\nThere's a lot to like about the Big Ten Champions. \n\nBut we really like the #2 seed, **Houston**. We've already backed them at 33-1 and will probably bet again. They look to have a manageable draw after smashing Cincinnati for the AAC chip.\n\nBeyond the Illini and Cougars, the Midwest also contains **San Diego State** and **Tennessee** in the Top 20 teams. Plus there are four other Top 30 teams, including Cade Cunningham's **Cowboys**, and Cameron Krutwig's **Ramblers**.\n\n### **Final Four From The Midwest**\n\nIllinois at +150 ($2.50) for the Final Four is too short.\n\nHouston +400 ($5) looks decent but 30-1 for the Title is probably better value for two more wins.\n\nWe love the Coogs.\n\n- - -\n\n## **NCAAB Title Predictions**\n\nFirstly, let's compare the odds:\n\n![March Madness Odds](/images/uploads/march-madness-odds.png \"March Madness Odds\")\n\nThe best odds in the world on Gonzaga are +250.\n\nThat's really short odds for the NCAA title. But the Zags are 5+ points better than every team in the country according to the Model. Plus, Gonzaga has never won the National Title. How long until that record breaks?\n\nSo we've been suggesting a bonus bet on Gonzaga for a few weeks. You can get **[$600 from BetMGM](https://promo.nj.betmgm.com/en/promo/geolocator?orh=promo.betmgm.com&wm=7051884#)** but they are only +200. Too short. Use the BetMGM bonus on something else.\n\nThe **[$500 bonus bet from PointsBet at +250](https://join.pointsbet.com/betrefinery-2rf/?utm_source=Unbounce_BetRefinery&utm_medium=Digital_Affiliate_CPA&utm_campaign=Risk_Free_2_500_1000_BetRefinery&utm_term=Unbounce&utm_content=BetRefinery&promo=REFINERY)** is the go. \n\nForgetting bonus bets, where is the value for your cold hard cash?\n\nHouston at 25-1 with Pointsbet or 30-1 with **[Play SugarHouse](https://wlsugarhouseaffiliates.adsrv.eacdn.com/PPC.ashx?btag=a_3460b_1581c_&affid=982&siteid=3460&adid=1581&c=&channelid=1&MediaID=1228&m=2|2&g=https%3a%2f%2fwww.playsugarhouse.com%2f%3fpage%3dsports%23filter%2ftennis%26btag%3da_3460b_1581c_%5baid%5d%5baddurlparams%5d)** is great value. Make sure you have a ticket on Houston at these odds. We have them as the fourth best team in the dance.\n\nWe don't mind a few pesos on Texas Tech at 60-1 too, for a real rough hope with a favorable draw.\n\nWe want a heavy ticket on the Zags for cash but can't pull the trigger at the current odds. They are incredibly powerful offensively, but their D is vulnerable and they have a tough path to the title. At +250, it's hard to bet up. We still remember what happened to Zion's Duke team at the same odds.\n\nOf the #1 seeds, Illinois is the best value with Bet365 at +800.\n\n## **Final March Madness Bets**\n\nMax bet is 5 units.\n\nWe bet $100 for 1 unit, but you convert accordingly:\n\n* **Back Houston at 20-1 or better for 2 units**\n* **Back Texas Texas at 60-1 for 0.5 units**\n* **Illinois at +800 for 2 units**\n* **Alabama Final Four at +450 for 2 units**\n\nWe're going to take on Michigan in the tournament. \n\nBaylor are legit but their odds are too short.\n\nWe'll nervously watch the Zags price all Tournament. If they hit +300 or better, pull the trigger.\n\n## **Extra Strategies**\n\nOur **[NCAA Model ](https://www.betrefinery.com/ncaab-betting/free-ncaab-picks)**has player point outputs for every day. We're really confident we can find sportsbook errors and pick them off.\n\nWe'll also be taking on Cade Cunningham and his Cowboys. They might have the number one pick in the draft, but they have a poor defensive rating. \n\nWe love to bet against the hype teams/players that the media doesn't shut up about. There's always value to zag, when others zig (no Gonzaga pun intended). Sportsbooks get so much action on Cade and Co, that the value is betting against.\n\nWe'll also look to back the best offensive teams in-play when they start slow. For example, down double digits at half time.\n\nThose teams are:\n\n* Gonzaga\n* Iowa\n* LSU\n* Alabama\n* Baylor\n* Florida State\n* UNC\n\nThat's it. \n\nGood luck in the dance friends. We can't wait.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Want more insight? Join the weekly email.**\n\n## **We promise it's worth your time.**\n\n## **<div name=\"brsignup\"></div>**",
