You will not find a better resource. Anywhere.\n\n<div name=\"brtable\" data-api-name=\"ncaab_ratings\"></div>\n\n- - -\n\n<!--Please note that changes to this code are not permitted.

And let's run through each region.\n\n## **West Predictions**\n\nOn face value, the West looks real tough.\n\nFour top 10 ranked teams is real nasty:\n\n* **Gonzaga**\n* **Iowa**\n* **Virginia**\n* **Kansas**\n\nThat's really tough. And the Zags are likely going to have to beat two of them just to make the Final Four.\n\nHowever, their Rating is just incredible. \n\nA score of 25.42 means they are 25 points better than the average team. Or 8 points better than Iowa and 7 points more than Virginia. Who we think'll run into.\n\nWe're expecting they'll get a real scare, but get through.\n\n### **Final Four From The West**\n\nThere is zero value in Gonzaga getting through though. -227 ($1.40) is horrible odds against potentially two top 10 teams. \n\nYou're better off backing them to win it all.\n\nVirginia at 10-1 is the value bet for the Final Four. They need to beat the Zags in the Sweet Sixteen but that's great value at the odds.\n\n- - -\n\n## **South Predictions**\n\nThose Bears of Baylor have been humbled recently and given away second place in the country to Illinois. On our rankings anyway.\n\nThey are still the comprehensive favorites, but our rankings have seven teams in the South, making up our top 20:\n\n* **Baylor**\n* **North Carolina**\n* **Texas Tech**\n* **Villanova**\n* **Ohio State**\n* **Wisconsin**\n* **Arkansas**\n\nPlus Purdue and Florida are only a few points worse.\n\nBaylor will get an early challenge in the Round of 32 with UNC and Wisconsin looking like the best 8/9 seeds in the comp.\n\nIf they survive that, it's probably 'Nova or Purdue. They should do it, but the Bear fights start early.\n\nOn the other side, we love Texas Tech, Ohio State or Arkansas to get through. The Model rates them all similarly. \n\n### **Final Four From The South**\n\n\\-125 looks very skinny for Baylor too. Steer clear.\n\nYou might get some good live prices and live handicaps if they face an early fight.\n\nThe best value is Texas Tech (7-1), Arkansas (8-1) and UNC (15-1). \n\n- - -\n\n## **East Predictions**\n\nWe don't love Michigan. They are the weakest #1, so we're going to try find the spot they lose.\n\nIt could very much be the Round of 32. LSU, who lost to 'Bama by 1 point in the SEC Final, are the fourth best offensive teams in the country. \n\nWe'll be backing LSU at the money and the plus.\n\nShould the Wolverines get through, they'll probably meet Alabama in the Elite 8. \n\n- - -\n\n## **Midwest Predictions**\n\ncoming soon.\n\n- - -\n\n## **NCAAB Final Four Predictions**\n\ncoming soon.\n\n- - -\n\n### **Want more insight?
