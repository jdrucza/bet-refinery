  "body": "Our golf model is running two fields this week; starting off with Workday Championship picks.\n\nThe final field for the WGC event is no joke as many of the world's best head to the Concession Golf Club in Bradenton, Florida.\n\nLet's run the outputs on our sports betting model and see if we can find a few bets.\n\n- - -\n\n## **2021 Workday Championship Outputs**\n\nHere are the outputs, and there's details on how the model was built down the bottom of the page.\n\n<div name=\"brtable\" data-file-name=\"tournamentPredictionsWorkday.json\" height=\"400px\"></div>\n\nNow, the next step is comparing these outputs vs the market. \n\nUntil our odds comparison is ready, we use **[Odds Boom](https://www.oddsboom.com/golf/futures/2636-puerto-rico-open/)**. \n\n- - -\n\n## **Workday Championship Picks**\n\n**There's plenty of close calls in these outputs.**\n\nPerenial model favorites like **Rahm**, **Xander**, **Cantlay** are borderline. But not quite bets.\n\nThe first eye catcher is **Webb Simpson**.\n\nThe Model makes Webb 26-1 but the books are showing 30-1. So that's a bet.\n\nWe'll keep looking...\n\n**Hideki Matsuyama** is another one. \n\nWe love the big fella from Japan. Model is 55-1. Market 60-1. \n\n**Adam Scott** and **Matthew Fitzpatrick** are slight overs too. 66-1 is the best at Pointsbet.\n\n**Louis Oosthuizen** is as well. 80-1 with Pointsbet.\n\n- - -\n\n<div class=\"predictIt\">\n\n**<a href=\"http://join.pointsbet.com/betrefinery-2rf/?utm_source=Unbounce_BetRefinery&utm_medium=Digital_Affiliate_CPA&utm_campaign=Risk_Free_2_500_1000_BetRefinery&utm_term=Unbounce&utm_content=BetRefinery&promo=REFINERY\" target=\"_blank\">WANT GREAT GOLF ODDS? JOIN POINTSBET</a>**\n\n</div>\n\n- - -\n\n## **Final Workday Championship Picks**\n\nWe're tempted to control the staking and just back Hideki and Webb, but we'll be sick if one of these other boys lob. So let's spray and pray:\n\n* **1.5 units Webb Simpson to win at 30-1**\n* **0.5 units Hideki Matsuyama to win at 60-1**\n* **0.35 units on Scott and Fitzpatrick at 66-1**\n* **0.3 units on Oosthuizen at 80-1**\n\nConsistent with the banner above, **[Pointsbet](**http://join.pointsbet.com/betrefinery-2rf/?utm_source=Unbounce_BetRefinery&utm_medium=Digital_Affiliate_CPA&utm_campaign=Risk_Free_2_500_1000_BetRefinery&utm_term=Unbounce&utm_content=BetRefinery&promo=REFINERY**)** actually have the best odds for all these blokes. Well done fellas. Less vig than the competition.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Why Should I Care About Your Model?**\n\nGlad you asked.\n\nFirstly, our chief data scientist is no joke. He makes a healthy living by betting off his sports models. \n\nHis most recent, our golf model, uses the last 15 years of data to produce win predictions for PGA tournaments. The model can be broken down into three stages:\n\n1. **Historic score adjustment** \n\n   Firstly, historic golf scores are adjusted to account for varying course difficulty and conditions on the day. For example a \"-2\" on a certain course/day combination may be an average score but on another course/day combination it might be a great score due to the course being more difficult and/or unfavorable conditions. This adjustment is necessary so that we can compare players on a like for like basis.\n2. **Score prediction** \n\n   We then create features using the adjusted historic scores and run a few machine learning algorithms on top of these, weighting each equally. These provide an accurate prediction for the most likely score that a player will achieve on an average course in the future.\n3. **Simulation**\n\n   Using these future score predictions, for a given tournament we can then simulate each player's score using their own score distribution to come up with win percentages and fair odds for each player in a tournament.\n\n- - -\n\n## **More Golf Betting Expertise**\n\nIf you love betting on golf like us, check out our **[Top 50 World Golf Rankings](https://www.betrefinery.com/golf-betting/world-golf-rankings)**.
