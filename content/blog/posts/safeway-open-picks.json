Not that they need any more advantages, given their incredible form.\n\nBut that's how the Tour Championship works. Top 30 ranked players over 72 holes.\n\nIt's important to remember that Rory McIlroy won the event in 2019. He started at -5, whereas Justin Thomas was -10.\n\nThis year, DJ starts at -10. Rahm -8. And JT -7. \n\nHere's the main hopes and their starting positions:\n\n![pga tour championship rankings](/images/uploads/pga-tour-championship-rankings.png \"pga tour championship rankings\")\n\nSo let's examine the outputs and see where the model lands. That will determine our entire suite of 2020 Tour Championship picks.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Safeway Open Predictions**\n\n<div name=\"brtable\" data-file-name=\"tournamentPredictionsSafeOpen.json\" height=\"400px\"></div>\n\nDespite the two stroke advantage, our Model thinks Rahm is more likely to win the tournament.\n\nWith that in mind, we're backing him to beat DJ in a tournament matchup at +110.\n\nBeyond that, we're really struggling to identify overlays. Which is when the Model's true probability is shorter than the market. Until our odds comparison API is on Bet Refinery, we use **[Odds Checker](https://www.oddschecker.com/us/golf/tour-championship/winner)**. \n\nThe closest value bet we can get to is our boy Xander. Who we love. But his true probability is about the same price as FanDuel. If we were itchy for a bet, we'd go there. But betting is about discipline so our plan of attack is to look through the props and find any glaring ommissions. We're sticking with Rahm over DJ, but who else gets our cash?\n\n- - -\n\n## **Safeway Open Picks**\n\n\n\n- - -\n\n## **Full Model Outputs: Image Version**\n\n![Safeway Open Picks](/images/uploads/image-8-.png \"Safeway Open Picks\")\n\n## **Why Should I Care About Your Model?**\n\nGlad you asked.\n\nFirstly, our chief data scientist is no joke. He makes a healthy living by betting off his sports models. \n\nHis most recent, our golf model, uses the last 15 years of data to produce win predictions for PGA tournaments. The model can be broken down into three stages:\n\n1. **Historic score adjustment** \n\n   Firstly, historic golf scores are adjusted to account for varying course difficulty and conditions on the day. For example a \"-2\" on a certain course/day combination may be an average score but on another course/day combination it might be a great score due to the course being more difficult and/or unfavorable conditions. This adjustment is necessary so that we can compare players on a like for like basis.\n2. **Score prediction** \n\n   We then create features using the adjusted historic scores and run a few machine learning algorithms on top of these, weighting each equally. These provide an accurate prediction for the most likely score that a player will achieve on an average course in the future.\n3. **Simulation**\n\n   Using these future score predictions, for a given tournament we can then simulate each player's score using their own score distribution to come up with win percentages and fair odds for each player in a tournament.\n\n- - -\n\n## **More Golf Betting Expertise**\n\nIf you love betting on golf like us, check out our **[Top 50 World Golf Rankings](https://www.betrefinery.com/golf-betting/world-golf-rankings)**.
