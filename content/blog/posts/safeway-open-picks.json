  "body": "Our Golf Model has your **Safeway Open picks**.\n\nAnd we must say, we love a B Grade PGA field. All the big dogs are staying fresh for the upcoming Majors on the calendar.\n\nAnd we think the market doesn't know enough about the next few tiers, so there's plenty of betting value to be found.\n\nOn this page you'll see:\n\n* The Golf Model outputs\n* Outputs vs The Market (where's the value?)\n* Final Safeway Open picks\n\n- - -\n\n## **Safeway Open Predictions**\n\n<div name=\"brtable\" data-file-name=\"tournamentPredictionsSafeOpen.json\" height=\"400px\"></div>\n\nOur sportsbook friends have **Si Woo Kim**, **Phil** and **Brendan Steele** on top.\n\nBut our Model doesn't. \n\nIt prefers The Irishman. Not Bobby De Niro, but **Shane Lowry**.\n\nFollowed by **Sergio Garcia**. And **Spiethy** pops up as the fourth most likely player to win at Silverado Resort and Spa.\n\nWith this kind of field, the Model has found plenty of value picks.\n\nWe're spoilt for choice.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Safeway Open Picks**\n\nThe Model certainly doesn't include BMI index in it's list of variables as it's found a few portly gentlemen that we love.\n\nFirstly, Shane Lowry should be favorite. There's a small overlay there for the win market which we'll support.\n\nOther players to stand out are:\n\n* **Sam Burns** at 50-1\n* **Talor Gooch** at 70-1\n* **Scott Piercy** 100-1\n* **Jhonattan Vegas** at 100-1\n* **Kevin Chappell** at 125-1\n* **Kiradech Aphibarnrat** at 250-1\n\nThe latter of which we just love.\n\nThe big unit swans around puffing the vape like a modern John Daley. He's in the team.\n\n![kiradech safeway open tips](/images/uploads/italian-open-day-four-viwgwd-qdrpx-1-.jpg \"kiradech\")\n\n## **Final Safeway Picks**\n\n* 0.5 units **Shane Lowry** at 30-1 with **BetMGM**\n* 1 unit on **Sam Burns** to Win at 50-1 with** [PointsBet ](http://join.pointsbet.com/betrefinery-2rf/?utm_source=Unbounce_BetRefinery&utm_medium=Digital_Affiliate_CPA&utm_campaign=Risk_Free_2_500_1000_BetRefinery&utm_term=Unbounce&utm_content=BetRefinery&promo=REFINERY)/ [SugarHouse](https://www.playsugarhouse.com/?btag=a_3460b_303c_&siteid=3460)**\n* 1 unit on **Kevin Chappell** at 33-1 with **[SugarHouse](https://www.playsugarhouse.com/?btag=a_3460b_303c_&siteid=3460)**\n* 1 unit on **Kiradech Aphibarnrat** Top 5 at 40-1 with **[PointsBet](http://join.pointsbet.com/betrefinery-2rf/?utm_source=Unbounce_BetRefinery&utm_medium=Digital_Affiliate_CPA&utm_campaign=Risk_Free_2_500_1000_BetRefinery&utm_term=Unbounce&utm_content=BetRefinery&promo=REFINERY)**\n\n- - -\n\n## **Full Model Outputs: Image Version**\n\n![Safeway Open Picks](/images/uploads/image-8-.png \"Safeway Open Picks\")\n\n## **Why Should I Care About Your Model?**\n\nGlad you asked.\n\nFirstly, our chief data scientist is no joke. He makes a healthy living by betting off his sports models. \n\nHis most recent, our golf model, uses the last 15 years of data to produce win predictions for PGA tournaments. The model can be broken down into three stages:\n\n1. **Historic score adjustment** \n\n   Firstly, historic golf scores are adjusted to account for varying course difficulty and conditions on the day. For example a \"-2\" on a certain course/day combination may be an average score but on another course/day combination it might be a great score due to the course being more difficult and/or unfavorable conditions. This adjustment is necessary so that we can compare players on a like for like basis.\n2. **Score prediction** \n\n   We then create features using the adjusted historic scores and run a few machine learning algorithms on top of these, weighting each equally. These provide an accurate prediction for the most likely score that a player will achieve on an average course in the future.\n3. **Simulation**\n\n   Using these future score predictions, for a given tournament we can then simulate each player's score using their own score distribution to come up with win percentages and fair odds for each player in a tournament.\n\n- - -\n\n## **More Golf Betting Expertise**\n\nIf you love betting on golf like us, check out our **[Top 50 World Golf Rankings](https://www.betrefinery.com/golf-betting/world-golf-rankings)**.
