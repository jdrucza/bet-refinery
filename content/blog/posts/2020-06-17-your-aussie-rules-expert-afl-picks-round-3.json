And don't think that last week was a fluke either, he won at 13% last year, which is as good as you'll ever seen, anywhere. \n\nWe should be paying $100/week for this mail.\n\nYou'll notice the quality of the tips by the way the line almost always moves in his favor.\n\n## **Best AFL Picks for Round 3 2020**\n\n- - -\n\n## **Richmond vs Hawthorn**\n\nRichmond have covered four straight against Hawthorn and look to be in a good spot to make it five. There was nothing pretty about their return draw with Colingwood. That matchup is significantly more difficult than Hawthorn. The Tigers have won 17 of their last 18 at the MCG when favoured by more than two goals including six of their last seven. Hawthorn have covered just six of 16 as an underdog. \n\n### **Recommended Bet:** \n\n**Richmond -14.5**\n\n### **Star To Watch:**\n\n**Jack Riewoldt #8 for Richmond**\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8D_5THz-Lek\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n\n- - -\n\n## **North Melbourne vs Sydney**\n\nThe Swans have historically been very good travellers and that is cranked up when they are an underdog with the Swans covering at 60% as a travelling outsider. The Swans have also covered six of their last nine off a loss. North are poor favourites, covering just six of 18 when the elect by more than a goal. The Swans strike as tremendous value here. \n\n**Recommended Bet:** \n\n**Sydney +9.5**\n\n### **Star To Watch:**\nIsaac Heeney #5 for Sydney\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5lA45AUV6MI\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n\n- - -\n\n## **Geelong vs Carlton**\n\nCarlton getting a big plus is always welcome as it is typically tremendous value. That is no exception this week. The Blues were typically their gritty best in a one-point loss to Melbourne last week. Carlton cover at 62% when getting more than three goals start. In Victoria, Carlton cover at 70% when getting a handicap of 24.5 or larger. Since 2012 the Cats cover at just 37% when favoured by four-plus goals. \n\n### **Recommended Bet:** \n\n**Carlton +28.5**\n\n### **Star To Watch:**\nEddie Betts - #18 for Carlton\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2ZUzFtATOxc\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>",
