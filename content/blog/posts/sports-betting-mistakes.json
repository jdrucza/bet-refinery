  "body": "We want you to be a better sports bettor. \n\nGambling is more fun when you when.\n\nTo help you on your journey, please listen to these six snackable pieces of advice from your favorite professional bettors, Bet Refinery.\n\n- - -\n\n1. ## **They Don't Compare Prices**\n\nThis might surprise some readers but odds are everything.\n\nLong term sports betting success isn’t determined by what team you’re backing. It’s determined by the odds you take vs their real win percentage.\n\nSure, there are exceptions. If you backed the Patriots at the moneyline and in Superbowl futures every year during the Brady Belichick years, it didn’t matter the odds. You were long term profitable. But the Pats are a once in a lifetime dynasty.\n\nBut for non Bostonions, sports betting success, over thousands of bets, is the odds vs the probability. You need to take the highest odds you can with every bet.\n\nIdeally, [your odds ](https://www.bestbetting-directory.com/)beat the closing line. Or your futures pick trades shorter during the season. That’s the mark of a pro.\n\nAnother example, is travel. Do you go straight to Delta’s website every time you fly domestic? You pay whatever they’re charging, just because you’re comfortable on their website, or you want the points?\n\nWell, sharp shoppers use airline comparison sites like Kayak so they get the best price. Because the difference in airfare can be half a week’s work. So we shop around.\n\nSports betting is no different.\n\nYou need an account at Draftkings.\n\nYou need an account at Fanduel.\n\nYou need an account at BetAmerica.\n\nNo just for our affiliate revenue at Bet Refinery. But because the odds vary at each book. And you need top price to improve your betting success.\n\n- - -\n\n2. ## **Bet On Everything**\n\nYou’ve heard the saying, “the riches are in the niches.”\n\nIt applies to sports betting.\n\nIf you want to win, you need to focus on the one or two sports you specialize in.\n\nYou can’t bet college football Saturday, NBA and NHL Saturday night, and then NFL on Sunday. I’m sorry Einstein, you can’t master four betting sports without a team of people.\n\nThe further down you niche, usually, the more successful you’ll be.\n\nSo only bet on the NBA.\n\nOr even better, only bet on NBA player props.\n\nOr even better, only bet on NBA rebounding player props. Become The Worm of rebounding props.\n\nNow this doesn't mean you can't have a play on football. Of course you can. Just adjust your staking so it reflects what's serious and what's fun.\n\nYour NBA rebounding bets might be $100 per unit.\n\nYour Sunday Funday bets might be $10 per unit.\n\n- - -\n\n3. ## **No Staking System**\n\nFurther to the point above, you need a staking system. You can't just bet $5 a unit last week because you’re broke and $50 a unit this week because you got your bonus at work.\n\nConsistency is key.\n\nYou might have a flat staking plan where every spread bet is $25.\n\nOr you might work out that your betting bank should be $1,000. And then each bet is between 0.1-2% of that bank, depending on your confidence.\n\nOr you get real fancy and google sports betting staking strategies and land yourself on Kelly Criterion.\n\nThere’s no bad answer above. The only bad answer is, I don’t need one.\n\n- - -\n\n4. ## **They Overuse Parlays**\n\nWe all love a big collect but we don’t like parlays longer than three legs.\n\nWhy? Well, for one, you can’t shop for odds.\n\n- - -\n\n5. ## **They Chase Their Losses**\n\nThis one is obvious. But it’s still so common.\n\nYou’re down for the day. For me, that means down a couple thousand. Rather than accept the Loss and log it into the system, you try to blast out. You’re betting in $500’s instead of $50’s on the west coast NBA games at half time.\n\nNow not one element of that is disciplined, professional punting. And what can maintain the habit is sometimes you do blast out. You turn -$3,000 into +$1,500. But that was once. More often than not, it becomes -$6,000.\n\n- - -\n\n6. ## **Drink and Bet**\n\nAnother simple one. \nDon't hit the booze and bet your brains out. \nAnd if you know you're watching the game at a sports bar, bet small and bet early. \n\n- - -\n\n7. ## **You Don’t Keep Records**\n\nTo be honest, I’m terrible at this. It requires work and I have lots of bets each week. I historically win at about ~ 4% which means I need to get my volume up. More bets, bigger bets.\n\nAll convenient excuses to not be accountable.\n\nEven if you bet for fun, with small stakes, this tip is a goldmine. You need to learn from your bets. You might dominate receiving yards and rushing props every week. But you bet a lot more on the totals, which you’re awful at.\nKeep track and get better. That’s the difference between winning and losing. And as you know, betting is a lot more fun when you’re winning.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nDiscipline is key to sports betting success. The more professional your bet placement and bet reviewing, the better you'll be.\n\nPerfect world, you take gambling seriously, record every bet and find your winning niche. \n\nHowever, that ain't realistic for most people. Do the bare minimum. Which is manage your staking system and don't bet when you're hammered or emotional.",
