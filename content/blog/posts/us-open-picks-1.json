  "body": "Our eyes light up when it's a week PGA Tour event, so we can't wait to see what the Golf Model finds as **Corales Puntacana picks**.\n\nYou probably haven't even heard of the favorite, Will Zalatoris.\n\nIn this python prediction for Puntanca piece, you'll find:\n\n* Our Golf Model outputs for the win market\n* Outputs vs The Market (where's the value?)\n* Final Corales Puntacana picks\n* Favorite tournament matchups\n\n- - -\n\n## **2020 Corales Puntacana Outputs**\n\n<div name=\"brtable\" data-file-name=\"tournamentPredictionsCorales.json\" height=\"400px\"></div>\n\nNext step is comparing these outputs vs the market. \n\nUntil our odds comparison is ready, we use **[Odds Checker](https://www.oddschecker.com/us/golf/corales-puntacana-resort-and-club-championship/winner)**. \n\nNow onto the standouts.\n\n- - -\n\n## **US Open Picks**\n\nRahm and DJ at the top. Yep. But no value there as the books have them shorter than our Model.\n\nNext up is a man that we mention every week. For darn good reason.\n\n**Xander Schauffele**.\n\nThe Model prices him at $14.37 which is fractionally under the +1400 at the books. That's technically a bet but we're going to try get better value.\n\nWhich means, if Xander doesn't get longer than +1400 we won't back him and we'll be violently ill on Sunday when he lobs...\n\n**Paul Casey.**\n\nThe Englishman is a value selection but we're going to back him Top 5, instead of just to win. He's only got the three PGA Tour wins and he's been playing professionally even longer than we've been betting.\n\nBut a second place finish at the PGA Championship this year shows he can challenge in the biggest tournaments.\n\n**Abraham Ancer.** \n\nThe 5'7 Italian finished second in RBC Heritage and has had a couple more top 15 finishes this year.\n\nThe Model makes him 77-1 but a few of the books have him 90-1.\n\n**Billy Horschel** is the next stand out selection. \n\nModel 105-1 vs Market 150-1. FanDuel are really sticking out here.\n\nSo we'll get involved.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Final PGA Championship Picks**\n\n* **Abraham Ancer:** 1 unit at 90-1 with **[SugarHouse](https://www.playsugarhouse.com/?btag=a_3460b_303c_&siteid=3460)**\n* **Billy Horschel:** 0.5 units at 150-1 with FanDuel\n* **Billy Horschel:** 0.5 units at 20-1 with FanDuel for **Top 5**\n* **Paul Casey:** 1 unit at 9-1 with **[SugarHouse](https://www.playsugarhouse.com/?btag=a_3460b_303c_&siteid=3460)** for **Top 5** \n\n## **Tournament Matchups**\n\n* **Tiger Woods** to beat Justin Rose +100\n* **Xander Schauffele** to beat Collin Morikawa -114\n\n- - -\n\n## **Full Model Outputs**\n\n![2020 US Open Picks](/images/uploads/2020-us-open-picks-bet-refinery.png \"2020 US Open Picks\")\n\n## **Why Should I Care About Your Model?**\n\nGlad you asked.\n\nFirstly, our chief data scientist is no joke. He makes a healthy living by betting off his sports models. \n\nHis most recent, our golf model, uses the last 15 years of data to produce win predictions for PGA tournaments. The model can be broken down into three stages:\n\n1. **Historic score adjustment** \n\n   Firstly, historic golf scores are adjusted to account for varying course difficulty and conditions on the day. For example a \"-2\" on a certain course/day combination may be an average score but on another course/day combination it might be a great score due to the course being more difficult and/or unfavorable conditions. This adjustment is necessary so that we can compare players on a like for like basis.\n2. **Score prediction** \n\n   We then create features using the adjusted historic scores and run a few machine learning algorithms on top of these, weighting each equally. These provide an accurate prediction for the most likely score that a player will achieve on an average course in the future.\n3. **Simulation**\n\n   Using these future score predictions, for a given tournament we can then simulate each player's score using their own score distribution to come up with win percentages and fair odds for each player in a tournament.\n\n- - -\n\n<div class=\"predictIt\">\n\n### As an American, you can bet on the US Election.
