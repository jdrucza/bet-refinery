The win earned him a spot in the Octagon, where he’s beaten Luis Henrique, Antonio Rogerio Nogueira and Devin Clark in succession.\n\nHis 15 finishes include 13 in the first round.\n\nSam Alvey (33-13) began his Light Heavyweight run with a knockout of Marcin Prachnio and a split decision over Gian Villante, raising him to 7-2 in his last nine. He has not tasted victory since, suffering knockout losses to Antonio Rogerio Nogueira and Jimmy Crute before dropping a decision to Klidson Abreu.\n\nHe faces a three-inch height disadvantage and a 3.5-inch reach disadvantage.\n\nOverused as the term “puncher’s chance” is, that’s all Alvey has here — Spann is younger, faster, taller, rangier and more versatile. If Spann still had the cardio issues that plagued him during his pre-Octagon career, I could see Alvey potentially catching him with a counter as he got sloppy, but the current incarnation of “Superman” is far less likely to present the opening Alvey needs to turn the tables.\n\nThat’s the key, really. Alvey exclusively waits for opportunities instead of making them, and considering that Spann’s reach lets him do damage from well outside the range of Alvey’s counter hooks, that’s not going to fly here. Depending on how much damage the Nogueira and Crute KO’s did to Alvey’s usually ironclad chin, Spann either picks him apart or crumples him by the end of the second round.\n\n*Our UFC Predictions: Spann by unanimous decision*",
