  "body": "March Madness is here (!) and you need our **NCAAB Basketball Rankings.**\n\nThere's no better place to research your bracket and make the right bets throughout the tournament. \n\nThe Rankings update each day and they aren't based on anything official from the NCAA or ESPN.\n\nThey're better. And much more accurate.\n\nThese rankings are created by a market beating sports betting Model. You simply won't find sharper outputs that help you directly compare each team.\n\nWe use these rankings to try and find which teams to back for the 2021 NCAA Championship.\n\nAnd we visit the **[Free NCAAB Picks](https://www.betrefinery.com/ncaab-betting/free-ncaab-picks)** page for the game by game outputs.\n\nIt's the same Model, this page is just a wider overview.\n\nWithout further ado, let's find the top teams in the country.\n\n- - -\n\n## **NCAAB Basketball Rankings**\n\nJust in time for March Madness, our NCAAB Basketball Rankings updates every single day.\n\nYou can see which teams excel at defense and which excel at offense, and see the recent movement.\n\nTheir last game should effect their ranking within 24 hours.\n\nAs you'll see, Gonzaga are offensive weapons and clearly the number one team.\n\n<div name=\"brtable\" data-api-name=\"ncaab_ratings\"></div>\n\n- - -\n\n<!--Please note that changes to this code are not permitted.

BetMGM are currently the best price in the world.\n\n- - -\n\n## **What does the Rating mean?**\n\nThe Gonzaga Bulldogs are 25.79 points better than average.\n\nThat means, they should start -26 against a school like La Salle, with a zero point Rating. On a neutral venue. \n\nThe Rating doesn't include home ground advantage either.\n\nFor example, how many points is Cameron Indoor Stadium worth to Duke pre-Covid? You would add that on top of the Rating.\n\n- - -\n\n## **NCAAB Basketball Rankings Commentary**\n\n**Gonzaga** are slightly distancing themselves from **Baylor and Illinois**. Over 5 points better in fact!\n\nWith **Illinois** making some serious ground too, distinguishing themselves as the second best team in the country.\n\nThe next two teams are where we get excited. Houston and Iowa. We've backed both of them at 33-1 for the Title. \n\nLooking at their ranking and likely seed (2 or 3), they should be about 15-1.\n\nYou can see the Model didn't like Michigan, even before their loss to MSU, so we'll love betting against them in the dance.\n\nVirginia and Arkansas are worth watching too.\n\nWe recommended the 2019 champs, Virginia, at 28-1 last week.\n\nWe'll have real clear bets after Selection Sunday.\n\n- - -\n\n### **Want more insight?
