  "body": "Your home of **NBA MVP odds** and predictions. \n\nWe LOVE betting NBA Futures. None more so than the MVP and ROY. \n\nThe key with the NBA MVP is it's a team award.\n\nI know you already know that, but the winning record is much bigger than you think. We'll show you.\n\nSo let's discuss the team influence, the best betting chances, and where the value is.\n\nSo bookmark this puppy and keep coming back to it as the year evolves because we'll update it.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Compare The Odds**\n\nWe'll always start with the odds. And trying to find the best price.\n\nFor the NBA MVP odds, we check out **[Odds Boom](https://www.oddsboom.com/nba/futures/26-regular-season-mvp/)** while we develop our own tech. These odds are from mid December 2020:\n\n![nba mvp odds](/images/uploads/nba-mvp-odds-boom.png \"nba mvp odds\")\n\nLeBron is not that price. Or we'd be chips in at +1500.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Back The Team, Not The Player**\n\nGoing back to 1980, 78% of MVP winners came from a team that had the strongest record in their Conference.`\n\n61% of them had the best record in the league.\n\nThat's outrageous. \n\nThe less successful regular teams just barely show up. Especailly after you remove the historically wrong Russell Westbrook decision...\n\nSo in order to bet on the NBA MVP before the season starts, we need to know the predicted team records.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Use The Season Total Predictions**\n\nThe best team win predictions are at **[Pinnacle](https://www.pinnacle.com/en/)**.\n\nNot only for the season win line, but you can see where the smart is pushing the team wins.\n\nYour local sportsbook should tell a similar story.\n\n![nba season win totals](/images/uploads/screenshot_20201217-133653-2.jpg \"nba season win totals\")\n\nAs you can see from the sample above, the Lakers, Clippers and Bucks are expected to have the best records. But the sharps are betting against the Clippers at 67%. \n\nWhich reduces the chance of Paul George or Kawhi Leonard winning. More influential is their rotational policy and regular season intent.\n\nOther relevant teams:\n\n* Celtics 62% (sharps on unders)\n* Nets 63% (sharps on unders)\n* Mavs 59%\n* Nuggets 61%\n* Heat 60%\n* Sixers 58% (sharps heavy on the overs with Harden rumours)\n* Blazers 55%\n* Raptors 59%\n* Jazz 58%\n\nThe Warriors at 53% is why Steph Curry is going to find it very hard to win. \n\nHe's under the odds at 11-1.\n\n- - -\n\n## **The Greek Freak**\n\nBased on the team picks, Giannis should be a comprehensive favorite.\n\nThe back to back winner, and his team, are expected to have the league's best record in 2021.\n\nWith that information, you can bet on Giannis. \n\nHis +500 odds will shorten over the course of the season.\n\nHowever, we can't pick the big fella as we ultimately don't think he'll win.\n\nEven Jordan didn't win three MVPs in a row. You have to go back to Larry Legend in the 80s.\n\nAdditionally, Giannis isn't winning rings. He's failed so far in the postseason. And we're betting that MVP voters will be reluctant to give him another trophy. \n\n- - -\n\n## **Doubting Doncic**\n\nWe absolutely LOVE the Euro MVP. \n\nHis 2020 Playoffs were incredible and he's so fun to watch. We love his injury prone running mate too.\n\nIt's inevitable he wins a few of these. But in season three, with the Mavs expected to finish about fourth in the West, he just can't be MVP favorite. He can't be.\n\nHe can win, absolutely. The Mavs might finish second in the West, but we're betting against.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Pick Your Laker**\n\nDoes LBJ get his first MVP in eight years? \n\nA lifetime achievement award to match Jordan's five MVPs.\n\nOr is he going to finally slow down?\n\nIf he does, it's ADs award to win.\n\nPending Davis' own health. \n\nWe're ready for the risk.\n\nWe think he should be right behind Giannis in the betting. The question marks over his alpha status within his own team and his record of staying healthy, means he's a risk. But there's generous compensation at +900.\n\nThat's over the odds. He's our first bet.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Return of The KD**\n\nSpeaking of health risks and elite talent.\n\nKevin Durant.\n\nReturns to the court in a wide open East (after the playoff stumbling Bucks). They look decent in the preseason.\n\nDurant +2000 is way too big. At the end of his career, you know KD's talent demands an extra MVP or two.\n\nHis achilles is a massive yellow flag for us but if he plays 80% of the season and the Nets finish top two in the East, he wins. The chance of that happening isn't 20-1.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Dame Time**\n\nAs a Blazers fan, this smells of heart over head. And contradicts the team first data we've discussed.\n\nHowever. There is a world in which the Blazers seriously over achieve in the regular season.\n\nNurkic and Hood returning, plus the acquisition of Covington and Derrick Jones Jnr is a huge offseason. Whiteside's absence is equally helpful.\n\nIn a Covid chaos season, a healthy Blazers team can seriously overachieve in the regular season and who better to cheer for than Dame Dollar. \n\n- - -\n\n## **Final NBA MVP Picks**\n\n* Back Anthony Davis at 9-1 for 5 units\n* Back Kevin Durant at 20-1 for 3 units\n* Back Damian Lillard at 20-1 for 2 units\n\n- - -\n\n#### **Want more insight?
