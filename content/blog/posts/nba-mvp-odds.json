  "body": "Your NBA MVP Odds \n\nCourtesy of our friends at Fanduel:\n\n![fanduel nba mvp odds](/images/uploads/nba-mvp-odds.png \"fanduel nba mvp odds\")\n\nGiannis is incredibly short odds, but he's arguably better value than LeBron at +400.\n\n## Basketball Reference Is Wrong\n\nA popular resource, which we love, is the [MVP tracker](https://www.basketball-reference.com/friv/mvp.html) at Basketball Reference. It tries to balance team record with individual stats. Which is what the NBA MVP is. However, it spreads the probability too wide, allocating significant percentages to unlikely candidates. \n\nFor example, James Harden is third in the market at 10.5%. \n\nHowever, the step-back king can't win the award with a 62.5% Win Loss record. Giannis' Bucks are 81.5%. \n\nHarden's stats can't overcome the team record. \n\nAnother poor prediction is Anthony Davis. He's not half as likely to win the MVP as LeBron. The first choice #23 has been the Lakers best player this year according to the media (who vote on it).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe don't recommend betting on the NBA MVP right now. There's too much Covid uncertainty. However, when the chat heats and the season is at a close, we monitor social media heavily. The media that vote often share there's on Twitter.\n\nIf LeBron is overindexing vs his price then, we'll back King James for the MVP. Similarly, if it's all Giannis on Twitter, where with the Big Buck. Even at -700 Giannis is a bet if the volume of media Tweets says he's home.",
