  "body": "Your home of **NBA MVP odds** and predictions. \n\nWe LOVE betting NBA Futures. None more so than the MVP and ROY. \n\nThe key with the NBA MVP is it's a team award.\n\nI know you already know that, but the winning record is even bigger than you think.\n\nSo let's discuss the team influence, the best betting chances, and where the value is.\n\nTwo of the most entertaining point guards of all time looking under the odds. \n\nSo bookmark this puppy and keep coming back to it as the year evolves because we'll update it.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Compare The Odds**\n\nWe'll always start with the odds. And trying to find the best price.\n\nFor the MVP, we check out **[Odds Boom](https://www.oddsboom.com/nba/futures/26-regular-season-mvp/)** while we develop our own tech. These odds are from mid December 2020:\n\n![nba mvp odds](/images/uploads/nba-mvp-odds-boom.png \"nba mvp odds\")\n\n- - -\n\n## **Back The Team, Not The Player**\n\nGoing back to 1980, 78% of MVP winners came from a team that had their Conference record.`\n\n61% of them had the best record in the league.\n\nBoth stats include ties.\n\nBut that's outrageous. \n\nThe historically wrong decisions, like Russell Westbrook's stat stuffing season, are really rare.\n\nSo in order to bet on the MVP pre-season, we need to know the predicted team records.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Use The Season Total Predictions**\n\nThe best record predictions are at **[Pinnacle](https://www.pinnacle.com/en/)**.\n\nNot only for the season win line, but you can see where the smart is pushing the team wins.\n\n![nba season wins line](/images/uploads/screenshot_20201217-133653.jpg \"nba season wins line\")\n\nAs you can see from the sample above, the Lakers, Clippers and Bucks are expected to have the best records. But the sharps are betting against the Clippers at 67%. \n\nWhich reduces the chance of Paul George or Kawhi Leonard winning. More influential is their rotational policy and regular season intent.\n\nOther relevant teams:\n\n* Celtics 62% (sharps on unders)\n* Nets 63% (sharps on unders)\n* Mavs 59%\n* Nuggets 61%\n* Heat 60%\n* Sixers 58% (sharps heavy on the voers with Harden rumours)\n* Blazers 55%\n* Raptors 59%\n* Jazz 58%\n\nThe Warriors at 53% is why Steph Curry is going to find it very hard to win. \n\nHe's under the odds at 11-1.\n\n- - -\n\n## **The Greek Freak**\n\nBased on the team picks, Giannis should be a comprehensive favorite.\n\nThe back to back winner, and his team, are expected to have the league's best record in 2021.\n\nWith that information, you can bet on Giannis. \n\nHis +500 odds will shorten over the course of the season. Presuming the Bucks win and his stats only continue to grow.\n\nHowever, we can't pick the big fella as we ultimately don't think he'll win.\n\nEven Jordan didn't win three MVPs in a row. You have to go back to Larry Legend in the 80s.\n\nAdditionally, Giannis isn't winning chips, he's failing when it really counts. And we're betting that MVP voters will be reluctant to give him another trophy. \n\n\n\n- - -\n\n## **Doubting Doncic**\n\nWe absolutely LOVE the Euro MVP. \n\nHis 2020 Playoffs were incredible and he's so fun to watch. We love his injury prone running mate too.\n\nIt's inevtiable he wins a few of these. But in season three, with the Mavs expected to finish about fourth in the West, he just can't be MVP favorite. He can't be.\n\nHe can win, absolutely. The Mavs might finish second in the West, but it's not a 1 in 5 chance.\n\n- - -\n\n## Final NBA MVP Picks\n\n* Back Anthony Davis\n* Back Kevin Durant\n* Back Damian Lillard",
