  "body": "Your home of **NBA MVP odds** and predictions. \n\nWe LOVE betting futures. None more so than the NBA MVP.. \n\nThe key with the NBA MVP is it's a team award.\n\nI know you already know that, but the winning record is much bigger than you think. \n\nWe'll show you.\n\nSo let's discuss the team influence, the best betting chances, and where the value is towards the end of February 2021.\n\nSo bookmark this puppy and keep coming back to it as the year evolves because we'll update it.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Why You Back The Team**\n\nGoing back to 1980, 78% of MVP winners came from a team that had the strongest record in their Conference.`\n\n61% of them had the best record in the league.\n\nThat's outrageous. \n\nThe less successful regular teams just barely show up. Especailly after you remove the historically wrong Russell Westbrook decision...\n\nAgain, the NBA MVP is a team award. \n\nLet's look at our current live bets and then review the market today.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Our Pre-Season NBA MVP Bets**\n\n* Back Anthony Davis at 9-1 for 5 units\n* Back Kevin Durant at 20-1 for 3 units\n* Back Damian Lillard at 20-1 for 2 units\n\nWe predicted the Lakers would have a strong record and went with AD over LeBron. Silly.\n\nWe thought Portland and Brooklyn would win more games than the market suggested at the start of the season.\n\nSo we backed them.\n\n## **Our January NBA MVP Bets**\n\n* LeBron James at 10-1 for 5 units\n\nAs you can see, we've had quite the outlay. \n\nBut we couldn't resist the LeBron odds in January. The Lakers had the league record and the King was putting up numbers.\n\nHis MVP media storm started soon after, crunching his odds in.\n\nLet's see where the market sits in February.\n\n- - -\n\n## **February 2021 Update**\n\nThe King is now as short as +125 with William Hill. +190 the top odds at Pointsbet.\n\nHere's the current market as at February 23 2021:\n\n![nba mvp odds](/images/uploads/nba-mvp-odds-bet-refinery-february.png \"nba mvp odds\")\n\nNow LeBron is way too short.\n\nYou can't back him now. The Lakers are on the slide with AD out.\n\nLeBron's entire NBA MVP campaign relies on the Lakers finishing with one of the league's best records.\n\nHe could arguably win with the fourth best record, but you really need the Lakers to have a better record to nudge out Joel Embiid.\n\nWe actually backed Embiid last year at 16-1, so we'll be sick if the big fella pulls it off this year.\n\nHe may well do. The Sixers need to finish top two in the East, probably on top, if the Eastern records are weaker than the West.\n\nAs you can guess, we don't give a flying fark what Jokic and Doncic season averages are. It's almost irrelevant. Luka Doncic cannot win the NBA MVP award. The Mavs at 13-15.The Nuggets would have to get a lot hotter than 16-14 for the Joker to be a real threat.\n\nBack on team records.\n\nThe Jazz are a collective unit. So are the Suns.\n\nThe Nets will be real hard to split. And we've all got Giannis MVP fatigue.\n\nThe serious players in the NBA MVP market, with the standings as they are, are:\n\n* LeBron James\n* Joel Embiid\n* Kawhi Leonard\n\nDame Lillard and Jokic would need to win 70-80% of their remaining games to be in the conversation. \n\nTo get even sharper, let's review our **[NBA Playoff Predictions](https://www.betrefinery.com/nba-betting/nba-playoff-predictions)** widget to help forecast the season. And therefore the NBA MVP.\n\nSort by #1 Regular Season column, or Top Conference:\n\n\n\n- - -\n\n### **Want more insight?
