  "body": "Your home of **NBA MVP odds** and predictions. \n\nWe haven't updated this page for two months. Because our incredible bet on LeBron James went up in flames with his industry. He went from +1000 to +150. Just as predicted.\n\nBut this 2021 season has been insane for injury influenced market movement. Plus, there are so many studs in the NBA at the moment. \n\nSo, who are we with now?\n\nWe'll let you know in the April update.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Why You Back The Team**\n\nGoing back to 1980, 78% of MVP winners came from a team that had the strongest record in their Conference.`\n\n**61% of MVPs had the best record in the league.**\n\nThat's outrageous. \n\nThe less successful regular teams just barely show up. Especailly after you remove the historically wrong Russell Westbrook decision...\n\nAgain, the NBA MVP is a team award. \n\nLet's look at our current live bets and then review the market today.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Our Pre-Season NBA MVP Bets**\n\n* Back **Anthony Davis** at 9-1 for 5 units\n* Back **Kevin Durant** at 20-1 for 3 units\n* Back **Damian Lillard** at 20-1 for 2 units\n\nWe predicted the Lakers would have a strong record and went with AD over LeBron. Silly.\n\nWe thought Portland and Brooklyn would win more games than the market suggested at the start of the season.\n\nSo we backed them.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Our Jan NBA MVP Bets**\n\n* **LeBron James** at 10-1 for 5 units\n\nAs you can see, we've had quite the outlay. \n\nBut we couldn't resist the LeBron odds in January. The Lakers had the league record and the King was putting up numbers.\n\nHis MVP media storm started soon after, crunching his odds in.\n\nLet's see where the market sits in February.\n\n- - -\n\n## **February 2021 Update**\n\nThe King is now as short as +125 with William Hill. +190 the top odds at Pointsbet.\n\nHere's the current market as at February 23 2021:\n\n![nba mvp odds](/images/uploads/nba-mvp-odds-bet-refinery-february.png \"nba mvp odds\")\n\nNow LeBron is way too short.\n\nYou can't back him now. The Lakers are on the slide with AD out.\n\nLeBron's entire NBA MVP campaign relies on the Lakers finishing with one of the league's best records.\n\nHe could arguably win with the fourth best record, but you really need the Lakers to have a better record to nudge out **Joel Embiid**.\n\nWe actually backed Embiid last year at 16-1, so we'll be sick if the big fella pulls it off this year.\n\nHe may well do. The Sixers need to finish top two in the East, probably on top, if the Eastern records are weaker than the West.\n\nAs you can guess, we don't give a flying fark what Jokic and Doncic season averages are. It's almost irrelevant. Luka Doncic cannot win the NBA MVP award. The Mavs at 13-15.The Nuggets would have to get a lot hotter than 16-14 for the Joker to be a real threat.\n\nBack on team records.\n\nThe Jazz are a collective unit. So are the Suns.\n\nThe Nets will be real hard to split. And we've all got Giannis MVP fatigue.\n\nThe serious players in the NBA MVP market, with the standings as they are, are:\n\n* **LeBron James**\n* **Joel Embiid**\n* **Kawhi Leonard**\n\nDame Lillard and Jokic would need to win 70-80% of their remaining games to be in the conversation. \n\nTo get even sharper, let's review our **[NBA Playoff Predictions](https://www.betrefinery.com/nba-betting/nba-playoff-predictions)** widget to help forecast the season. And therefore the NBA MVP.\n\nSort by #1 Regular Season column, or Top Conference:\n\n<div name=\"brtable\" data-api-name=\"nba_futures\"></div>\n\nOur odds, right now, would be:\n\n* **LeBron James +200 ($3)**\n* **Joel Embiid +300 ($4)**\n* **Kawhi Leonard +1000 ($11)**\n* **Giannis, Dame, KD, Jokic +2000 ($21)**\n* **Steph 40-1**\n* **Luka, Mitchell and Gobert 50-1**\n\nKawhi at 40-1 is therefore amazing odds.\n\nAs you can see, we've already bet our brains out but another ticket at those odds won't ruin our book.\n\nThe knock on Kawhi is he's only played 25 of 32 games. However, if the Clippers finish right next to Utah, or on top of the League, what odds is he then?\n\nFarking short.\n\nNow we've done our balls on Kawhi about five times in NBA MVP betting over the years. But these are the best odds we've ever seen for a team that can finish with the first or second best record.\n\n## **February NBA MVP Bets**\n\n### **Back Kawhi Leonard at 40-1 for 1.5 units.**\n\n- - -\n\n### **Want more insight?
