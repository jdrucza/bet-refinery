  "body": "Your home of **NBA MVP odds** and predictions. \n\nWe LOVE betting NBA Futures. None more so than the MVP and ROY. \n\nThe key with the NBA MVP is it's a team award.\n\nI know you already know that, but the winning record is much bigger than you think. We'll show you.\n\nSo let's discuss the team influence, the best betting chances, and where the value is.\n\nSo bookmark this puppy and keep coming back to it as the year evolves because we'll update it.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Our Pre-Season NBA MVP Bets**\n\n* Back Anthony Davis at 9-1 for 5 units\n* Back Kevin Durant at 20-1 for 3 units\n* Back Damian Lillard at 20-1 for 2 units\n\n- - -\n\n## **January 2021 Update**\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers are +275 to win the title.\n\nAccording to our NBA Playoff Predictions outputs, the Lakers are a 59% chance of becoming the #1 seed.\n\nThat's huge.\n\nBecause 61% of NBA MVP winners came from the #1 seed (in the last 40 years).\n\nIf you look at the Lakers stats or refer to Basketball Reference's **[MVP page](https://www.basketball-reference.com/friv/mvp.html)**, you'll notice that LeBron has been better than his teammate, Anthony Davis (who we backed for MVP at the start of the year).\n\nWe've already invested 10 units. \n\nSuper happy with the Kevin Durant picks at 20-1, especially now with Harden on the roster.\n\nBut you want to have the potential goat (we say that very reluctantly as MJ worshippers) onside. \n\nImagine the media narrative if the Lakers are the number 1 seed and LeBron plays the season without injury?\n\nHe becomes -300. \n\nRight now, his odds are 10-1, which is even better than when he started the season.\n\nTake a look at the odds comparison from Odds Boom on January 19th 2021:\n\n![nba mvp odds](/images/uploads/nba-mvp-odds-2021.png \"nba mvp odds\")\n\nUnbelievable. \n\nLuka still way too short when the Mavs are 10th in the league.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Why You Back The Team**\n\nGoing back to 1980, 78% of MVP winners came from a team that had the strongest record in their Conference.`\n\n61% of them had the best record in the league.\n\nThat's outrageous. \n\nThe less successful regular teams just barely show up. Especailly after you remove the historically wrong Russell Westbrook decision...\n\nSo in order to bet on the NBA MVP before the season starts, we need to know the predicted team records.\n\n- - -\n\n## **January NBA MVP Pick**\n\nLuka cannot be +350 on the team with a losing record.\n\nThat means there is lots of value elsewhere.\n\nWe still love Kevin Durant at 20-1. 8-1 is still slight overs.\n\nBut you have to have LeBron onside.\n\n#### **Lebron James 5 units at 10-1.**\n\n- - -\n\n#### **Want more insight?
