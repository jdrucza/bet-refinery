  "body": "Your home of **NBA MVP odds** and predictions. \n\nWe haven't updated this page for two months. Because our incredible bet on LeBron James went up in flames with his injury. He went from +1000 to +150. Just as predicted.\n\nBut this 2021 season has been insane for injury influenced market movements. Plus, there are so many studs in the NBA at the moment. \n\nSo, who are we with now?\n\nWe'll let you know in the April update.\n\nFirstly, re-read the history. The NBA MVP is a team award.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Why You Back The Team**\n\nGoing back to 1980, 78% of MVP winners came from a team that had the strongest record in their Conference.`\n\n**61% of MVPs had the best record in the league.**\n\nThat's outrageous. \n\nThe less successful regular teams just barely show up. Especailly after you remove the historically wrong Russell Westbrook decision...\n\nAgain, the NBA MVP is a team award. \n\nLet's look at our current live bets and then review the market today.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Our Previous Betting Recommendations**\n\nFull disclosure. In the best case scenario, we get our money back.\n\nThe good news for you though is you can get our final bet, which we think wins. Without all the sunken costs.\n\nBefore the final recommendation(s), here's our sunken costs:\n\n* **Anthony Davis** at 9-1 for 5 units\n* **Kevin Durant** at 20-1 for 3 units\n* **Damian Lillard** at 20-1 for 2 units\n* **LeBron James** at 10-1 for 5 units\n* **Kawhi Leonard** at 40-1 for 1.5 units\n\n- - -\n\n## **April 2021 Update**\n\n![nba mvp odds 2021](/images/uploads/nba-mvp-odds-2021-april.png \"nba mvp odds 2021\")\n\nIt's a two horse race, really. And we didn't pick either of them earlier. \n\nOuch! Anyway...\n\nJokic vs Embiid.\n\nThe big Nugget hasn't missed a game and is averaging almost 26/11/9. Which is farking insane.\n\nBut his Nuggets only have the sixth best record in the league.\n\nSo do voters skew towards Russell Westbrook voting, or do they follow the team betting formula?\n\n\\-110 for Jokic is just too short for us. He even got as short as -250, which is just the wrong price with 17 games left.\n\nWith Jamal Murray going down with injury, the expectation for some is Jokic's numbers go up.\n\nBut we're not sure. They compliment each other so well and the offense already runs through Jokic. I think he's the second most used offensive player on any team, after Doncic.\n\nSo he can't get any more of it. \n\nWe just think the Nugs lose a few more games than they would have, which hurts Jokic.\n\nSo as you can expect, **we've bet up on Embiid at +500 ($6.0).**\n\nWe're obviously betting on the Sixers team record.\n\nI know Embiid has missed a tonne of games (18 atm), but he has a presence and profile than Jokic doesn't. He's also equally unstoppable with nearly 30 and 11. \n\nMost importantly, his team has a real chance to win the Conference. \n\nSo we're backing Joel, who was already heavily discussed as the best player in 2021, before his injury.\n\nThe only other player that we still think is way overs the odds is Kawhi. His Clippers are still winning plenty of basketball games and it won't take much to make that a media focus should LAC be able to catch the Suns for the second best league in the game.\n\n## **Final MVP Bets**\n\n* **Back Joel Embiid** at +300 or better (not any less)\n* **Back Kawhi Leonard** at 100-1 (it's the wrong price)\n\n- - -\n\n### **Want more insight?
