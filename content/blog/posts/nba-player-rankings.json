  "body": "You can get **NBA Player Rankings** at Bleacher Report and dozens of other places. \n\nStat stuffers and big brand players, all ordered according to who has the biggest box score averages. Overlayed with one dude's personal opinion.\n\nBut do these fantasy all stars win you games of basketball? Do they cover the line when you need them? How many rings do Russell Westbrook and James Harden have again?\n\nOur NBA Player Rankings are different. Like really different.\n\nOur winning sports betting Model has created a real Plus Minus. \n\nSo it determines how well the player goes when they are on the court with respect to who else is on the court on their team and opposition. So it assumes that their presence, whether in attack or defense has some impact on the score.\n\nESPN started it, and our market beating statistician has created his own version which has evolved over many years.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Why Are Some MVP Candidates Below Role Guys?**\n\nBecause it's about their impact on the W. It's also influenced by team performance. For example, you'll notice that the teams leading the league will dominant the player list.\n\nLosing record offensive machines might dominate fantasy for you but they will never top our NBA Player Rankings. \n\nLuka Doncic, for example, is much lower than you'd think. One reason is his defense. In that, his team force roughly 60% more turnovers when Luka is not on the court compared to when he is.\n\nOur numbers move around too because they reflect their current form right now. It's not dominated by a career of numbers. It's recent form.\n\nLastly, you'll see guys like Patty Mills ranking well on 25 minutes per game. But his court time has a limit to it, making him less effective than a 35 minute All-Star that is just below him on the table.\n\nWithout further ado, what it do.\n\n- - -\n\n## **NBA Player Rankings**\n\n![NBA Player Rankings](/images/uploads/nba-player-rankings.png \"NBA Player Rankings\")\n\n![NBA Player Rankings](/images/uploads/nba-player-rankings-2.png \"NBA Player Rankings\")\n\n![NBA Player Rankings](/images/uploads/nba-player-rankings-3.png \"NBA Player Rankings\")\n\n![NBA Player Rankings](/images/uploads/nba-player-rankings-4.png \"NBA Player Rankings\")\n\n![NBA Player Rankings](/images/uploads/nba-player-rankings-5.png \"NBA Player Rankings\")\n\n- - -\n\n## **Want more insight?
