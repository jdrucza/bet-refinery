  "body": "You can get **NBA Player Rankings** at Bleacher Report and dozens of other places. \n\nStat stuffers and big brand players, all ordered according to who has the biggest box score averages. Overlayed with one dude's personal opinion.\n\nBut do these fantasy all stars win you games of basketball? Do they cover the line when you need them? How many rings do Russell Westbrook and James Harden have again?\n\nOur NBA Player Rankings are different. Like really different.\n\n\n\n\n\neah its really interesting stuff. Luka way down the list as well. It uses real plus minus, so it determines how well the player goes when they are on the court with respect to who else is on the court on their team and opposition. So it assumes that thier presence, wether in attack or defense has some impact o the score. ESPN started it a while back with some guy working for one of the NBA teams. Notice that they also have patty mills in 15th position.Â  Luka is like 58th on their list, and down on this one too. they say that this could be to his defense. In that, his team force turnovers 60% more when Luka is not on the court than when he is on.\n\n\n\nNumbers will bounce around on my ratings a lot more than ESPN's. ESPN looks at this season only, and the average over the course of the season. Mine looks at a weighted moving average over many seasons, and the idea is not to look at their rating over the course of the year (like ESPN), but rather their current form now\n\none way in which you could make the numbers maybe more in line of what most people think is weight their rating by averagae minutes played. Patty mills pays around 25 mins a game compared to Jokic at 35. So the number of minutes played is an indication of the coach wanting that player on the court. I think that could be good. I'll change that up and see how they look.\n\n\n\n\n\n- - -\n\nThen you're in the right place.\n\nFar more accurate than any NBA journo or content marketing kid, these NBA Player Rankings are created by a market beating Model. \n\nYou won't see it get carried away by a few good games or some lucky momentum.
