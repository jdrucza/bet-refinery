But only when his chance to win greatly exceeds his odds. Which it does in Houston!\n\nConsider this. He's 50-1 to win the Masters (again). Yet Draftkings have Scotty 40-1 to win against this field?!? \n\nGTFO\n\nBet. Bet. Bet\n\nWith that spoiler alert, let's see what other players the Model loves as Houston Open Picks.\n\n- - -\n\n## **2020 Houston Open Predictions**\n\n<div name=\"brtable\" data-file-name=\"tournamentPredictionsHouston.json\" height=\"400px\"></div>\n\nNow let's compare these outputs versus the market.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Houston Open Picks**\n\nAs we said, Adam Scott is a bet. He should be 27-1. Draftkings are betting you 40-1.\n\nYummy.\n\n- - -\n\n<div class=\"predictIt\">\n\n**<a href=\"http://join.pointsbet.com/betrefinery-2rf/?utm_source=Unbounce_BetRefinery&utm_medium=Digital_Affiliate_CPA&utm_campaign=Risk_Free_2_500_1000_BetRefinery&utm_term=Unbounce&utm_content=BetRefinery&promo=REFINERY\" target=\"_blank\">WANT GREAT GOLF ODDS?

He makes a healthy living by betting off his sports models. \n\nHis most recent, our golf model, uses the last 15 years of data to produce win predictions for PGA tournaments. The model can be broken down into three stages:\n\n1. **Historic score adjustment** \n\n   Firstly, historic golf scores are adjusted to account for varying course difficulty and conditions on the day. For example a \"-2\" on a certain course/day combination may be an average score but on another course/day combination it might be a great score due to the course being more difficult and/or unfavorable conditions. This adjustment is necessary so that we can compare players on a like for like basis.\n2. **Score prediction** \n\n   We then create features using the adjusted historic scores and run a few machine learning algorithms on top of these, weighting each equally. These provide an accurate prediction for the most likely score that a player will achieve on an average course in the future.\n3. **Simulation**\n\n   Using these future score predictions, for a given tournament we can then simulate each player's score using their own score distribution to come up with win percentages and fair odds for each player in a tournament.\n\n- - -\n\n## **More Golf Betting Expertise**\n\nIf you love betting on golf like us, check out our **[Top 50 World Golf Rankings](https://www.betrefinery.com/golf-betting/world-golf-rankings)**.
