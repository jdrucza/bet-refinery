And I believe that if Conor McGregor’s going to win, it’s probably going to be a pretty similar fight. \n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8c7y8g3nQPE\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nIt’s hard to draw too many inferences from Conor’s recent action, since his 40 seconds against Donald Cerrone is his only action since October 2018. But, if the Cerrone fight taught us anything, it’s that Conor’s still pathologically aggressive and one of the best, quickest starters in the sport’s history. Poirier’s improved defensively since their first bout, but still is liable to having issues with being blown out of the water by faster starters.  \n\nThe main question is more ‘what happens if Conor can’t blast Poirier out of there inside half a round?’. The fight becomes a lot more interesting should Conor be unable to blitzkrieg his way to victory. Conor’s gastank’s never been an especially strong asset of his (which is further magnified by his historical tendency for frothing-at-the-mouth aggression), and Poirier’s developed over time into a sterling attritive fighter with great output. I think he’s a bit less overtly favorable for Conor than the Cerrone matchup is, as Poirier’s less fragile and likely will take over more emphatically if given the opportunity. \n\nIf Conor’s gonna cover his -300 price point, it’s predicated on him blitzing Poirier out of there in short order. Hence I’d generally recommend a play on Conor KO @ -169 than the moneyline. \n\nA submission would be a surprise, though you never know with club-sub opportunities and I’d be pretty shocked by Conor overcoming the volume and cardio disparities in order to take a decision.\n\nIf Poirier’s still standing, I think the fight becomes a hell of a lot more interesting. \n\nI like the price on Poirier submission out at +1100 as Conor’s historically tended to be a fairly easy tap once he gets tired. And Poirier’s very happy to work his BJJ game. \n\n### **Prediction**\n\nConor McGregor by KO in Round 1.\n\n### **UFC 257 Picks**\n\n* 2 units Conor McGregor KO at -169 with Pointsbet\n* 0.5 units Poirier Submission at +1100 with FanDuel\n\n### **In-Play Strategy**\n\nIf Poirier is still standing after 7.5 minutes, you want to back him live.\n\n### **More UFC Video Content To Enjoy:**\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TuQRQZn9M5A\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n- - -\n\n## **Amanda Ribas v Marina Rodriguez**\n\nAmanda Ribas is probably the next big thing at Women’s Straw-weight, and Marina Rodriguez is very good at striking but lacks a lot of depth in the grappling game. I personally consider this more of an IQ test for Ribas than anything, as she’ll be given the choice between ‘get into a kickboxing match with Marina and have a lot of trouble against a top three WSW pure striker’ and ‘go for takedowns and likely actually cover her -300 pricepoint.  \n\nBest way to cover the difference is to just play the Ribas Sub price at +340, in my opinion. \n\nIf Ribas is electing to grapple proactively and having success getting takedowns, sub will look like a value play. If Ribas is either failing to grapple proactively, or get takedowns when she’s going for them, it’s going to be very difficult for her to justify that -300 pricing whilst she’s kickboxing.  \n\n### **Prediction**\n\nRibas by Submission in Round 1.\n\n### **UFC 257 Picks**\n\n* 1.5 units on Ribas Submission +340 at FanDuel\n\n- - -\n\n#### **Want more insight?
