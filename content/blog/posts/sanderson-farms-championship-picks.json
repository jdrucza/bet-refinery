You NEED multiple betting accounts for that reason.\n\nOk, onto Adam Long and the other picks that stood out.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Sanderson Farms Championship Picks**\n\nFor us, it's as simple as comparing the outputs vs the market.\n\n**Adam Long** is 30-1 on the Model and 35-1 on the market. \n\nHe finished fifth last week and tied for 13th at the US Open! His odds seem too big for this size field.\n\n**Henrik Stenson** is another stand out. We found the veteran Swede last week and he lights up the Model again at 55-1.\n\n**Sam Burns** is another the Model loved last week so we'll trust in the process. Which is easy to do when we remind ourselves that our rankings had Jon Rahm and Xander Schauffele as undervalued by the market, before they both exploded.\n\nSepp Straka is 85-1 with **DraftKings**. We'll have a nimble on the big Austrian at those odds. Top 5 probably worth a look too.\n\nFinal Picks\n\n* 1 unit Adam Long at 35-1 with BetMGM\n* 0.5 units Henrik Stenson at 55-1 with BetMGM / Bet365\n* 0.75 units Sam Burns at 27-1 with FanDuel\n* 0.3 units Sepp Straka at 85-1 with DraftKings\n\n- - -\n\n## **Why Should I Care About Your Model?**\n\nGlad you asked.\n\nFirstly, our chief data scientist is no joke. He makes a healthy living by betting off his sports models. \n\nHis most recent, our golf model, uses the last 15 years of data to produce win predictions for PGA tournaments. The model can be broken down into three stages:\n\n1. **Historic score adjustment** \n\n   Firstly, historic golf scores are adjusted to account for varying course difficulty and conditions on the day. For example a \"-2\" on a certain course/day combination may be an average score but on another course/day combination it might be a great score due to the course being more difficult and/or unfavorable conditions. This adjustment is necessary so that we can compare players on a like for like basis.\n2. **Score prediction** \n\n   We then create features using the adjusted historic scores and run a few machine learning algorithms on top of these, weighting each equally. These provide an accurate prediction for the most likely score that a player will achieve on an average course in the future.\n3. **Simulation**\n\n   Using these future score predictions, for a given tournament we can then simulate each player's score using their own score distribution to come up with win percentages and fair odds for each player in a tournament.\n\n- - -\n\n## **More Golf Betting Expertise**\n\nIf you love betting on golf like us, check out our **[Top 50 World Golf Rankings](https://www.betrefinery.com/golf-betting/world-golf-rankings)**.
