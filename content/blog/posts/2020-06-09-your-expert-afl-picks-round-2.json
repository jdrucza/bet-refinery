Usually, there would be 80,000-100,000 people in the crowd. This year, empty.\n\nRegardless of the Covid conditions, Collingwood are always reliable plays when getting more than a goal. They have **covered 60%** getting a start of 6.5 or more since 2011. They have covered 11 of their last 15 at the MCG when an outsider of more than a goal. \n\nRichmond, on the other hand, have covered just nine of 19 at the MCG. And Collingwood have covered two of their last three against Richmond. In a cracking matchup to restart the season the Pies can win a close affair against the defending premiers.\n\n### AFL Pick\n\nCollingwood +7.5 (-110 at BetMGM)\n\n### Star To Watch\n\nDustin Martin - #4 for Richmond\n\nThe tattooed looking biker for Richmond with the rough haircut is one of the game's best players. His 'don't argue' is legendary:\n\n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABJMVdTWqro>\n\n- - -\n\n### Geelong vs Hawthorn\n\nThe Cats are typically very hard to beat when playing at Geelong. And that advantage is sure to be heightened in this muddled-up season with a short preparation. \n\nGeelong have covered 10 of their last 14 at their home ground and **cover at 60%** at the ground when favored by fewer than three goals. \n\nThe Hawks, however, have covered just six of their last 15 as an underdog.\n\n### AFL Pick\n\nGeelong -10.5 (-110 at BetMGM)\n\n### Star To Watch\n\nPatrick Dangerfield - #35 for Geelong\n\nOne of the best in the game. Runs 100m in less than 11 seconds and kicks more goals than any midfielder.\n\n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3US_s-u4x-U>\n\n- - -\n\n### Carlton vs Melbourne\n\nCarlton are in a great spot as an underdog in Melbourne against the Demons. The Blues **cover at a stunning 61%** in Victoria when an underdog. As a double-digit underdog in Melbourne the Blues have covered 10 of their last 16. \n\nThe Demons have covered just five of their last 18 in Victoria and went a poor 1-6 against the spread in 2019 when favored by the market.\n\n### AFL Pick\n\nCarlton +12.5 (-110 at Bet365)\n\n### Star To Watch\n\nPatrick Cripps - #9 for Carlton \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SzveGlt3WA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SzveGlt3WA)",
