  "body": "We've incredibly excited to share our Golf Model's **Tour Championship Picks**.\n\nSpoiler alert: We're with Xander. \n\nTo quote the golf loving president, the overlay is \"yyyyyyuge\". Yuge.\n\nDJ and Rahm are clear tournament favorites. They're in phenomenal form and unique to the Tour CHampionship event, they start in front of the field. DJ at -10, Rahm at -8.\n\nHere's the main hopes and their starting positions:\n\n![pga tour championship rankings](/images/uploads/pga-tour-championship-rankings.png \"pga tour championship rankings\")\n\nDespite the starting advantage and red hot form, our model says Rahm and DJ are under the odds.\n\nBut it loves Xander.\n\nSo let's examine the outputs and see where the model lands. That will determine our entire suite of 2020 Tour Championship picks.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Tour Championship Predictions**\n\n<div name=\"brtable\" data-file-name=\"tournamentPredictionsTourChampionship.json\" height=\"400px\"></div>\n\nNext step is comparing these outputs vs the market. \n\nUntil our odds comparison API is on Bet Refinery, we use **[Odds Checker](https://www.oddschecker.com/us/golf/bmw-championship/winner)**. \\\nAs we'll always tell you, it's imperative to shop for the best odds. You NEED multiple betting accounts for that reason.\n\nUpon examination, DJ is crazy short. +190 is the best you'll see and that's with BetMGM. Our Model has him twice that.\n\nRahm, similarly, is +300 at Pointsbet. But that's too short too.\n\nJustin Thomas, starting at -7, is udners as well. \n\nAs we've said, the absolutely glaring bet is **Xander Schauffele**. We mark him the third best player in the world.\n\nYou can get +2700 with Fanduel and close to that with other books. \n\nThe Model thinks he's a 12-1 chance of winning.\n\n**Rory McIlroy** is also a bet. 19-1 with the Model and 25-1 with BetMGM and Bet365. BET.\n\n**Hideki Matsuyama** and **Tony Finau** are also clear bets for us at BetMGM.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Final Tour Championship Picks**\n\n* **Xander Schauffele: 1 unit at 27-1** with FanDuel\n\n- - -\n\n## **Full Model Outputs**\n\n![Tour Championship Picks](/images/uploads/tour-championship-picks-2020-xander-and-others.png \"Tour Championship Picks\")\n\n## **Why Should I Care About Your Model?**\n\nGlad you asked.\n\nFirstly, our chief data scientist is no joke. He makes a healthy living by betting off his sports models. \n\nHis most recent, our golf model, uses the last 15 years of data to produce win predictions for PGA tournaments. The model can be broken down into three stages:\n\n1. **Historic score adjustment** \n\n   Firstly, historic golf scores are adjusted to account for varying course difficulty and conditions on the day. For example a \"-2\" on a certain course/day combination may be an average score but on another course/day combination it might be a great score due to the course being more difficult and/or unfavorable conditions. This adjustment is necessary so that we can compare players on a like for like basis.\n2. **Score prediction** \n\n   We then create features using the adjusted historic scores and run a few machine learning algorithms on top of these, weighting each equally. These provide an accurate prediction for the most likely score that a player will achieve on an average course in the future.\n3. **Simulation**\n\n   Using these future score predictions, for a given tournament we can then simulate each player's score using their own score distribution to come up with win percentages and fair odds for each player in a tournament.\n\n- - -\n\n## **More Golf Betting Expertise**\n\nIf you love betting on golf like us, check out our **[Top 50 World Golf Rankings](https://www.betrefinery.com/golf-betting/world-golf-rankings)**.
