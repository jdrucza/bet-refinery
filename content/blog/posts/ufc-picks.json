But how many of them are professional sports bettors? 1%, 2%? \n\nMost of UFC Picks you'll find are from someone who doesn't bet or loses more than most. \n\nAt Bet Refinery, we leverage the expertise of full time sports bettors and there are few betting in the UFC space than **[Gugabe](https://twitter.com/Gugabed)**. \n\nOur man makes a full time living on the sport.\n\nWe're honored to have his tips on Bet Refinery for free.\n\nFor the extra special sauce including his props (which he dominates), pay the man **[HERE](https://www.betmma.tips/mma_handicapper_stats.php?ID=118760)**.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Marlon Vera vs  Sean O’Malley**\n\nThis is a fight between two guys I’d historically faded, but one that I think represents an opportunity in how incredibly wide the price is on a coinflip. Sean O’Malley’s price is getting pushed to silly territory by his extra-curricular renown, and yet I think Vera’s going to produce a razor-thin fight in this one as they’re both high tempo strikers. Malley’s an explosive, bouncy kicking-heavy striker who usually flags as the minutes wear on, and Vera’s recently changed his game from ‘random opportunism’ into ‘high volume random opportunism’. \n\nAnd it’s the shift of Vera’s game to actually incorporate strong volume that’s had me actually come to respect what he does. The Ecuadorian is absurdly tough and has an incredible gastank, so the pivot towards actually putting up volume consistently makes a lot of sense. It might be a bit… obvious, but steering into your physical advantages is something that fighters need to do more often. Malley’ll also happily indulge him in a ‘swing to death’ standing, which is something that I feel favors Marlon Vera. \n\nI also feel that Malley’s power/dominance is a bit overrated at this point. His fight with Eddie Wineland, for instance, whilst a lovely highlight reel KO, wasn’t exactly on-track to be a 10-8 when the KO happened. Vera is historically absurdly durable and throws a ton of volume, so I feel it’s hard for Malley to really justify the line unless he decides to pull a wrestling game out of his back-pocket that he hasn’t really shown as of this point. Malley’s fame outside the game also makes it quite possible this price continues to improve, but I’ll take a shot now.  \n\n### **Prediction:**\n\nControversial Split Decision \n\n### **Recommended Bet:**\n\n2units on Marlon Vera @ +240 \n\n- - -\n\n## **Daniel Pineda vs Herbert Burns**\n\nHerbert Burns continues to be a striking defense liability with mediocre process, and thus it’s relevant to my interests when he gets put against a dangerous striker like Daniel Pineda. Main issue is that Pineda’s perhaps not the wisest guy when it comes to how he elects to engage in grappling, but I feel that the holes in Burns’ game are big enough that it’s hard to justify Pineda’s current price holding despite a good chance that this devolves into a sloppy mess. \n\nPineda’s on his second UFC run-around, after a mixed run on the regionals. He’s pathologically aggressive in just about every phase, hits hard and usually a good opportunistic submission threat. This might be a huge issue against an elite BJJ player, in that I could easily see him randomly deciding to fling himself into a guard sub after a period of clear, clean domination on the feet. But the price here just doesn’t make sense. \n\nThere’s also a potential that Pineda fights like an intelligent human being following a gameplan, which’d have me actively favoring him, but sadly UFC bouts aren’t quite at a point where that’s reliable. \n\n### **Prediction:**\n\nBinary mess ending in the first round. \n\n### **Recommended Bet:**\n\n2 units on Daniel Pineda @ +220\n\n- - -\n\n## **John Dodson vs Merab Dvalshivili**\n\nI’m a big fan of both of these gentlemen, having maxbet Merab in his outing against Casey Kenney and generally supporting Dodson in all of his endeavors. But I think that Dodson is one of the worst matchups for Merab in the division. Merab’s an incredible output machine, but that is tempered by the fact that he has the defensive integrity of a building. He’ll usually be charging facefirst towards his opponents at all times, which is a good thing when he’s fighting somebody that lacks elite power, but Dodson hits absurdly hard. \n\nDodson’s also historically hard to wrestle consistently, incredibly mobile, and Merab tends to rely on exhausting his opposition in order to really take advantage of his wrestling abilities. Merab’s general enthusiasm/activity makes me lean the KO prop over Dodson moneyline, just since a weird tepid decision where Merab wins on forward motion despite getting lamped a few times is live.  \n\n### **Prediction:**\n\nDodson KO1 \n\n### **Recommended Bet:**\n\n1.5 units on Dodson KO @ +400 \n\n- - -\n\n## **UFC Betting Guide**\n\nWant to learn how to win more with your UFC bets?\n\nRead our **[Ultimate Guide on UFC Betting](https://www.betrefinery.com/blog/bet-on-the-ufc/)**.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Historic Results**\n\nCheck out how our man went for the previous events:\n\n* **[UFC Vegas 5](https://www.betrefinery.com/ufc-betting/ufc-vegas-5-picks/)**\n* **[UFC Fight Night 174](https://www.betrefinery.com/ufc-betting/ufc-fight-night-174-picks/)**\n* **[UFC Fight Night Saskatoon](https://www.betrefinery.com/ufc-betting/ufc-fight-night-picks-saskatoon/)**\n* **[UFC 250](https://www.betrefinery.com/ufc-betting/ufc-250-predictions/)**",
