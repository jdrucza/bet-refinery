  "body": "Season 2021 has only just started but we're already itching for a futures bet.\n\nSo we've built an **MLB Playoff Prediction Model.** \n\nCan anyone stop the Dodgers? How short should they be, and where are the value bets?\n\nLets run the numbers and take a look.\n\n- - -\n\n## **MLB Playoff Predictions**\n\nUsing our Model, let's try find some bets for the World Series. Or the post season.\n\nThe following table is updated at the end of every night. So you know you're getting the freshest predictions.\n\n<div name=\"brtable\" data-api-name=\"mlb_futures\"></div>\n\n- - -\n\n<div class=\"predictIt\">\n\nWant **the biggest promos?**\n\nStart with **$2,000** in bonus bets.\n\n**<a href=\"https://join.pointsbet.com/betrefinery-2rf/?utm_source=Unbounce_BetRefinery&utm_medium=Digital_Affiliate_CPA&utm_campaign=Risk_Free_2_500_1000_BetRefinery&utm_term=Unbounce&utm_content=BetRefinery&promo=REFINERY\">JOIN POINTSBET NOW!</a>**\n\n</div>\n\n- - -\n\n## **MLB Futures Interpretation**\n\nLet's start by looking at the best odds from all the sportsbooks, courtesy of Odds Boom.\n\nThis was provided on the 16th of April:\n\n![MLB playoff predictions](/images/uploads/mlb-world-series-odds-april-22.png \"MLB playoff predictions\")\n\nThe **Dodgers** are as good as advertised and insanely short. \n\nThe defending champions are actual value at +333 if you shop at Fox Bet but we can't be steaming into those odds in April.\n\nThey'll be damn hard to beat though. 20% better chance of winning the World Series than every other team.\n\nThe **Yanks**, however, are grossly underpriced in the market.\n\nFor us, you want to check out the **Houston Astros**. 20-1 in the Market, +1350 from the Model.\n\nGreat bet.\n\n**Tampa Bay** at 28-1 are just as good.\n\nAnd another team that clearly stands out is the **Washington Nationals**. \n\nI know. DC isn't known for trophies. But the 60-1 Market offering is an enormous differential from 20-1. \n\nWe're backing Washington at those odds. Wynnbet, pull your pants down please.\n\nAnd speaking of Wynnbet. If you want to throw a hail mary, the **Giants** are huge odds too. Stevey Wynn was offering 200-1 on a World Series win but he's been clipped. The best odds now are still value, at 120-1.\n\n## **Best Bets For April**\n\n* **Astros 20-1**\n* **Rays 28-1**\n* **Nationals 60-1**\n* **Giants 120-1**\n\n- - -\n\n## **More MLB Resources**\n\nWe LOVE betting futures.
