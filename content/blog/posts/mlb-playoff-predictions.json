How short should they be, and where are the value bets?\n\nLets run the numbers and take a look.\n\n- - -\n\n## **MLB Playoff Predictions**\n\nWe'll automate this table in the coming weeks. Bare with us.\n\nAnd bet with us.\n\n![nhl playoff predictions](/images/uploads/mlb-futures-1-april-16.png \"nhl playoff predictions\")\n\n![nhl playoff predictions 2](/images/uploads/mlb-futures-2-april-16.png \"nhl playoff predictions 2\")\n\n- - -\n\n<div class=\"predictIt\">\n\nWant **the biggest promos?**\n\nStart with **$2,000** in bonus bets.\n\n**<a href=\"https://join.pointsbet.com/betrefinery-2rf/?utm_source=Unbounce_BetRefinery&utm_medium=Digital_Affiliate_CPA&utm_campaign=Risk_Free_2_500_1000_BetRefinery&utm_term=Unbounce&utm_content=BetRefinery&promo=REFINERY\">JOIN POINTSBET NOW!</a>**\n\n</div>\n\n- - -\n\n## **MLB Futures Interpretation**\n\nLet's start by looking at the best odds from all the sportsbooks, courtesy of Odds Boom.\n\nThis was provided on the 16th of April:\n\n![MLB playoff predictions](/images/uploads/oddsboom-mbl-world-series-odds.png \"MLB playoff predictions\")\n\nThe **Dodgers** are as good as advertised. \n\nThe defending champions should be +350 in the market and will take a lot to beat. Again.\n\nThe **Yanks**, however, are grossly underpriced to do it.\n\nFor us, you want to check out the Houston Astros. +1600 in the Market, +1200 from the Model. An overlay worth watching (or betting on).\n\nBut the clear early bet we need to have is the **Washington Nationals**. \n\nI know. DC isn't known for trophies. But the 50-1 Market offering is an enormous differential from 15-1. \n\nWe're backing Washington at those odds. Wynnbet, pull your pants down please.\n\nAnd speaking of Wynnbet. If you want to throw a hail mary, the Giants are huge odds too. Stevey Wynn is offering 200-1 on a World Series win. The Model says San Fran win this season every 50 times it's run.\n\n- - -\n\n## **More MLB Resources**\n\nWe LOVE betting futures.
