  "body": "Our MLB Playoff Predictions Model is farking insane. \n\nHere are the only bets we shared after we launched it in April:\n\n* **Astros 20-1**\n* **Rays 28-1**\n* **Nationals 60-1**\n* **Giants 120-1**\n\nNo surprise that Washington let us down but the other three picks are absolutely mind blowing.\n\nAstros are now 5-1, Rays are 16-1 and Giants are 12-1!\n\nLets see if we can replicate those incredible futures bets by finding value in the market now.\n\n- - -\n\n## **MLB Playoff Predictions**\n\nThe following table is updated at the end of every night. So you know you're getting the freshest predictions.\n\n<div name=\"brtable\" data-api-name=\"mlb_futures\"></div>\n\n- - -\n\n<div class=\"predictIt\">\n\nWant **the biggest promos?**\n\nStart with **$2,000** in bonus bets.\n\n**<a href=\"https://join.pointsbet.com/betrefinery-2rf/?utm_source=Unbounce_BetRefinery&utm_medium=Digital_Affiliate_CPA&utm_campaign=Risk_Free_2_500_1000_BetRefinery&utm_term=Unbounce&utm_content=BetRefinery&promo=REFINERY\">JOIN POINTSBET NOW!</a>**\n\n</div>\n\n- - -\n\n## **August MLB Futures Value**\n\n![mlb playoff predictions world series](/images/uploads/screen-shot-2021-08-02-at-12.41.30-pm.png \"mlb playoff predictions world series\")\n\nSo the Dodgers should be favs.\n\nBut there's no value at +325.\n\nAnd you can't back the Astros now, after we tipped them at 20-1.\n\nHowever, you can back Tampa Bay.\n\nWe're going again at 16-1. They should be 10-1 for the World Series.\n\nYou can also back the Blue Jays at 30-1.\n\nThe Braves, at 60-1, didn't even fit on our screenshot. But you can snatch them up Atlanta fans. Should be half the price.\n\nThe Mets and Padres are way too short. Sorry Mets fans. Even with Javier Baez.\n\nSo thats it.\n\nThe three teams to snipe at the start of August are:\n\n* Rays 16-1\n* Blue Jays 30-1\n* Braves 60-1\n\nTampa Bay are the pick of those.\n\n- - -\n\n## **April MLB Futures Interpretation**\n\nThis was provided on the 16th of April:\n\n![MLB playoff predictions](/images/uploads/mlb-world-series-odds-april-22.png \"MLB playoff predictions\")\n\nThe **Dodgers** are as good as advertised and insanely short. \n\nThe defending champions are actual value at +333 if you shop at Fox Bet but we can't be steaming into those odds in April.\n\nThey'll be damn hard to beat though. 20% better chance of winning the World Series than every other team.\n\nThe **Yanks**, however, are grossly underpriced in the market.\n\nFor us, you want to check out the **Houston Astros**. 20-1 in the Market, +1350 from the Model.\n\nGreat bet.\n\n**Tampa Bay** at 28-1 are just as good.\n\nAnd another team that clearly stands out is the **Washington Nationals**. \n\nI know. DC isn't known for trophies. But the 60-1 Market offering is an enormous differential from 20-1. \n\nWe're backing Washington at those odds. Wynnbet, pull your pants down please.\n\nAnd speaking of Wynnbet. If you want to throw a hail mary, the **Giants** are huge odds too. Stevey Wynn was offering 200-1 on a World Series win but he's been clipped. The best odds now are still value, at 120-1.\n\n## **Best Bets For April**\n\n* **Astros 20-1**\n* **Rays 28-1**\n* **Nationals 60-1**\n* **Giants 120-1**\n\n- - -\n\n## **More MLB Resources**\n\nWe LOVE betting futures.
