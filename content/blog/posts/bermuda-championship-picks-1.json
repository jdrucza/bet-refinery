Developed by one of the best sports betting data scientists in the world.\n\nNow let's find a winner.\n\n- - -\n\n## **2020 Bermuda Championship Outputs**\n\nHere are the outputs from our Model. Details on how it was built are down the bottom of the page.\n\n<div name=\"brtable\" data-file-name=\"tournamentPredictionsBermuda.json\" height=\"400px\"></div>\n\nNow, the next step is comparing these outputs vs the market. \n\nUntil our odds comparison is ready, we use **[Odds Checker](https://www.oddschecker.com/us/golf/bermuda-championship/winner)**. \n\n- - -\n\n## **Bermuda Championship Picks**\n\nThe clear standout betting option, as the title suggests, is the veteran Swede. **Henrik Stenson**.\n\nWe'll avoid the Ikea reference this time around and just say that the Model has him 33-1 and the sportsbooks have him 40-1.\n\nThat is a juicy overlay.\n\nRemember, we're here to find value in the market. Not pick a favourite that is under the odds.\n\nBeyond Stenson, we need to go a few players down the board to circle the Duffman. **Jason Dufner**. \n\nBet365 is offering 100-1 and there's some 90-1 around as well.\n\n### **Final Bermuda Championship Picks**\n\n* Back Henrik Stenson at 40-1 with 1 unit\n* Back Jason Dufner at 100-1 with 0.5 units\n\n- - -\n\n<div class=\"predictIt\">\n\n**<a href=\"http://join.pointsbet.com/betrefinery-2rf/?utm_source=Unbounce_BetRefinery&utm_medium=Digital_Affiliate_CPA&utm_campaign=Risk_Free_2_500_1000_BetRefinery&utm_term=Unbounce&utm_content=BetRefinery&promo=REFINERY\" target=\"_blank\">WANT GREAT GOLF ODDS?

He makes a healthy living by betting off his sports models. \n\nHis most recent, our golf model, uses the last 15 years of data to produce win predictions for PGA tournaments. The model can be broken down into three stages:\n\n1. **Historic score adjustment** \n\n   Firstly, historic golf scores are adjusted to account for varying course difficulty and conditions on the day. For example a \"-2\" on a certain course/day combination may be an average score but on another course/day combination it might be a great score due to the course being more difficult and/or unfavorable conditions. This adjustment is necessary so that we can compare players on a like for like basis.\n2. **Score prediction** \n\n   We then create features using the adjusted historic scores and run a few machine learning algorithms on top of these, weighting each equally. These provide an accurate prediction for the most likely score that a player will achieve on an average course in the future.\n3. **Simulation**\n\n   Using these future score predictions, for a given tournament we can then simulate each player's score using their own score distribution to come up with win percentages and fair odds for each player in a tournament.\n\n- - -\n\n## **More Golf Betting Expertise**\n\nIf you love betting on golf like us, check out our **[Top 50 World Golf Rankings](https://www.betrefinery.com/golf-betting/world-golf-rankings)**.
