Trinaldo’s 41 years old, and is yet still a fringe top 15 Lightweight.\n\nHe’s only been emphatically beaten once since 2014, against James Vick, with his other losses to Hernandez (Dodgy decision) and Kevin Lee (Miracle comeback head kick) not really passing the ‘clear minute winner’ standard. Jai Herbert is a flashy Cage Warriors kickboxer, making his debut in the UFC, who has a grappling game that struggled notably with UK Cage Warriors’ personnel.\n\nA takedown is likely game over for Herbert, as Trinaldo’s top game is incredibly vicious, and even standing I don’t think Herbert’s streets ahead of where Trinaldo is. Herbert’s offensively potent, but has had some noted issues with his chin (Herbert-McKee is available on Youtube and a rather soft KO loss) and does his best work in the clinch where Trinaldo is possibly at his best.\n\nI don’t really see Herbert having many coherent paths to victory here outside of spectacular, highlight-reel Explosive Kickboxer KO or Trinaldo coming in looking like the 41 he is, instead of the ageless wonder he frequently fights like.\n\nPure kickboxing I’d consider the price to be about right, but Trinaldo’s advantages in any sort of grappling phase are so gigantic that I don’t see how a 1.62 price is holding.\n\nI’ll not go too crazy due to Trinaldo’s age and inconsistency with going for the grappling approach, but I also feel that this is Trinaldo’s softest competition since Chad Laprise and that the majority of his recent fights have been against people with grappling skills of their own.\n\n### **Fight Prediction**\n\nTrinaldo by Submission +750 with FoxBet\n\n### **Betting Pick**\n\nTrinaldo to Win for 3 units at -134 with **[SugarHouse ](https://wlsugarhouseaffiliates.adsrv.eacdn.com/C.ashx?btag=a_3460b_303c_&affid=982&siteid=3460&adid=303&c=)**or DraftKings\n\n- - -\n\n### **Antonio Rogerio Nogueira vs Mauricio Rua**\n\nSpeaking of Pensioner battles, I just think that Lil Nog has a bit more left in the tank than Shogun. This is the UFC equivalent of Barry Hall v Paul Gallen, but I feel that Nog is generally more able to take a punch than Shogun, who is 1-1-1 in his last 3 but could easily be 0-3 with them all being KO1s if the referees were in different moods and Paul Craig wasn’t Paul Craig.\n\nTheir last fight in 2015, which was also considered as a last hurrah and a possible double-retirement spot for two legendary veterans, ended by controversial, tight decision. I just feel Shogun’s declined more than Lil Nog due to his propensity for fighting more frequently.\n\nBut this is going to be a dumpster fire. I think Lil Nog’s got more left in the tank athletically despite being the older man, and that he should thus be narrowly favored in what some people could consider a sad old man fight.\n\n### **Fight Prediction**\n\nAntonio by KO1 +650 Fanduel / Foxbet / BetMGM\n\n### **Betting Pick**\n\nAntonio Rogerio Nogueira to Win for 2.5 units at +160 with Fanduel",
