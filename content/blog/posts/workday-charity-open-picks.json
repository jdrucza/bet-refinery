Confusingly, this week's tournament is being played at the Muirfield Village Golf Club, which will also host next week’s Memorial Tournament.\n\nWe can't remember the last time the PGA Tour played on the same course in consecutive weeks. That said, we're just glad the sport continues in any form, as Covid continues to rage against the machine.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Muirfield Village Course**\n\nNow that you know what deck they're playing, lets look at how it plays.\n\nWe enjoy the **[course fit tool](https://datagolf.com/course-fit-tool)** at Data Golf. Muirfield Village doesn't have any dominating features, suiting driving accuracy and iron play:\n\n![data golf Muirfield Village ](/images/uploads/screenshot-2020-07-09-06.14.00.png \"data golf Muirfield Village \")\n\nAdditionally, the PGA has communicated that this week’s installment will feature shorter lengths and slower green speeds. There's also a little rain around. So expect some strong scoring this weekend.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Workday Charity Open Picks 2020**\n\nSo who wins? Or at least, who do our favorite experts see as value.\n\nThe **Betfair Golf Model** has:\n\n* John Rahm\n* Sungjae Im\n* Matthew Fitzpatrick\n\n- - -\n\nThe **Data Golf Model**, which is very similar to the market, has:\n\n* John Rahm 7.3% (roughly 12-1)\n* Justin Thomas 6.6% (roughly 13-1)\n* Hideki Matsuyama 6.3% (roughly 13-1)\n\n- - -\n\n**Steve The Punter** on Betfair UK likes:\n\n* Will Besseling @ 75-1\n* Bubba Watson @ 140-1\n* Ryan Armour @ 150-1\n* Mackenzie Hughes @ 200-1\n* Joel Stalter @ 300-1\n* Brendan Steele @ 300-1\n* Harry Higgs @ 500-1\n\n- - -\n\n**Dave Tindall** is with:\n\n* Rickie Fowler each-way at 28-1\n* Kevin Streelman each-way @ 60-1\n* Corey Conners each-way @ 70-1\n\n- - -\n\n## **Final Workday Charity Open Picks**\n\nAs the title suggests, we're going with John Rahm.\n\nWe'll have something small on Sungjae Im. The South Korean prodigy often gets our cash.\n\nAnd then we'll back Corey Conners as well. Both the Golf Model at Betfair and Dave Tindall like the Canadian.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Bonus**\n\nDon't forget our exclusive guide on **[How To Win At Golf Betting](https://dev.betrefinery.com/golf-betting/how-to-bet-on-golf)**.",
