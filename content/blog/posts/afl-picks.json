Our expert, who works at a sportsbook in Australia, won at 13% last year. He's been winning on Aussie Rules for a decade.\n\nEach week he shares his best three bets at the spread. Get them early as the line almost always moves in his favor.\n\n- - -\n\n## **AFL Picks Round 6**\n\n## **Geelong vs Brisbane**\n\nThe Cats take on the Lions this week … at the SCG. Such is 2020. \n\nMore than happy to take the Cats as an underdog. They have covered at 60% as an outsider since 2012. As an interstate outsider, the Cats have covered 9 of 13 as an interstate underdog so they travel well. \n\nThe Lions have covered just 1 of their last 5 as an interstate favorite and they have a poor 36% cover rate in night games.\n\n### **Recommended Bet:**\n\nGeelong +5.5\n\n- - -\n\n## **West Coast vs Adelaide**\n\nAdelaide are a complete and utter mess. They are winless and without a cover in five games this year. \n\nThey have not lobbed within 20 points in their last four. West Coast seemed to have stemmed the bleeding this year with an impressive 34-point win over the Swans. \n\nThe Eagles are 28-15 against the line when favored by five goals.\n\n### **Recommended Bet:**\n\nWest Coast -30.5\n\n- - -\n\n## **Carlton vs Western Bulldogs**\n\nCarlton cover at 58% when a double digit underdog and look in a good spot again against the Western Bulldogs. The Blues cover at 64% when a double digit outsider off a loss of three or more goals. The Bulldogs cover at just 41% as a favorite and have made the nut in must 5 of their last 17 when favored. The Blues are the bet … again. \n\n### **Recommended Bet:**\n\nCarlton +11.5\n\n- - -\n\n## **2020 Results**\n\nOur guru is 9 from 15 so far this year. Insane results. Hopefully not great variance and he can win at 10%+ when the season finishes.\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 5**\n\n* Carlton +8.5 **LOSS**\n* Essendon +17.5 **WIN**\n* North Melbourne +6.5 **LOSS**\n\n- - -\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 4**\n\n* Sydney +3.5 **LOSS**\n* Collingwood -6.5 **LOSS**\n* North Melbourne +7.5 **WIN**\n\n- - -\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 3**\n\n* Richmond -14.5 **LOSS**\n* Sydney +9.5 **WIN**\n* Carlton +28.5 **WIN**\n\n- - -\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 2**\n\n* Collingwood +7.5 **WIN**\n* Geelong -10.5 **WIN**\n* Carlton +12.5 **WIN**\n\n- - -\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 1**\n\n* West Coast -19.5 **WIN**\n* Carlton +19.5 **LOSS**\n* Fremantle +15.5 **WIN**",
