  "body": "Each week we share **AFL Picks** from a profitable sports bettor in Australia.\n\nOur provider, who works anonymously because of contractual agreements, has been winning on his AFL picks for ten years. His custom database focuses on trends, agnostic of player changes.\n\nUnless there has been some late player news, you'll notice the line movements shifting towards his recommendations, a sign of his sharpness.\n\nMost importantly, he **won at 13% profit on turnover in 2019**. \n\nLast week his AFL Picks went a shocking 0 from 3. The week before? 3 from 3. \n\nLet's hope he gets the momentum back and he gets our hard earned money each week and we look forward to his profitability returning to 10%+.\n\n- - -\n\n## **AFL Picks Round 14**\n\n## **Hawthorn vs Essendon**\n\nEssendon are the worst favourites in the AFL since 2012 so are in a prime play-against spot. The Bombers have covered at just 37% when the elect in betting. When favoured by more than a goal, the Bombers make the nut at just 32%. The Hawks cover at 53% when an underdog and they have covered six of nine against Essendon. \n\n### **Recommended Bet:** \n\nHawthorn +6.5\n\n- - -\n\n## **Western Bulldogs vs Geelong**\n\nThe Cats are in a good spot here. Geelong have covered 9 of their last 12 when favoured by fewer than two goals. Geelong have also won their last four by 28-plus points and have covered four of their last six against the Bulldogs. \n\n### **Recommended Bet:** \n\nGeelong -9.5\n\n- - -\n\n## **Melbourne vs St Kilda**\n\nSt Kilda have covered just six of their last 17 when favoured so the Demons look the play in this one. The Demons have covered six of their last nine off a loss of 24 or more and they have covered three of their last four interstate. \n\n### **Recommended Bet:** \n\nMelbourne +2.5\n\n- - -\n\n- - -\n\n## **2020 Results: AFL Picks**\n\n20 winners from 39 bets.\n\n## **AFL Picks Round 13**\n\n* Geelong -35.5 **LOSS**\n* West Coast -18.5 **LOSS**\n* North Melbourne +15.5 **LOSS**\n\n- - -\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 12**\n\n* Bulldogs -3.45 **WIN**\n* West Coast -27.5 **WIN**\n* Geelong +4.5 **WIN**\n\n- - -\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 11**\n\n* Richmond -2.5 **LOSS**\n* West Coast -19.5 **WIN**\n* North Melbourne +10.5 **LOSS**\n\n- - -\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 10**\n\n* GWS -14.5 **LOSS**\n* Melbourne -14.5 **WIN**\n* Collingwood -16.5 **LOSS**\n\n- - -\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 9**\n\n* Sydney+13.5 **LOSS**\n* Carlton -10.5 **LOSS**\n* Essendon +15.5 **LOSS**\n\n- - -\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 8**\n\n* Sydney+6.5 **WIN**\n* West Coast **\\-**5.5 **WIN**\n* Fremantle +10.5 **LOSS**\n\n- - -\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 7**\n\n* Geelong +4.5 **LOSS**\n* North Melbourne +15.5 **LOSS**\n* Carlton +15.5 **WIN**\n\n- - -\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 6**\n\n* Geelong +5.5 **WIN**\n* West Coast -30.5 **WIN**\n* Carlton +11.5 **WIN**\n\n- - -\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 5**\n\n* Carlton +8.5 **LOSS**\n* Essendon +17.5 **WIN**\n* North Melbourne +6.5 **LOSS**\n\n- - -\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 4**\n\n* Sydney +3.5 **LOSS**\n* Collingwood -6.5 **LOSS**\n* North Melbourne +7.5 **WIN**\n\n- - -\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 3**\n\n* Richmond -14.5 **LOSS**\n* Sydney +9.5 **WIN**\n* Carlton +28.5 **WIN**\n\n- - -\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 2**\n\n* Collingwood +7.5 **WIN**\n* Geelong -10.5 **WIN**\n* Carlton +12.5 **WIN**\n\n- - -\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 1**\n\n* West Coast -19.5 **WIN**\n* Carlton +19.5 **LOSS**\n* Fremantle +15.5 **WIN**",
