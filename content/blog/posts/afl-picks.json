  "body": "Each week we share **AFL Picks** from a profitable sports bettor in Australia.\n\nOur provider, who works anonomously because of contractual agreements, has been winning on his AFL picks for ten years. His custom database focuses on trends, agnostic of player changes.\n\nUnless there has been some late player news, you'll notice the line movements shifting towards his recommendations, a sign of his sharpness.\n\nMost importantly, he **won at 13% profit on turnover in 2019**. \n\nLast week his AFL Picks went 3 from 3. \n\nHe's gets our hard earned money each week and we look forward to his profitability returning to 10%+.\n\n- - -\n\n## **AFL Picks Round 13**\n\n## **Geelong vs Adelaide**\n\nThe winless Crows have remarkably covered just 1 of their last 12 games this year. \n\nThey are losing by an average margin of nearly 40 points. In a shortened Covid game, mind you.\n\nThey got thumped by 57 last week by the Bulldogs and they have lost three of their last four by 50-plus points. \n\nThe Cats are 8-4 against the spread this season and come off three straight wins of 33-plus. This is going to get messy.\n\n### **Recommended Bet:**\n\nGeelong -35.5\n\n- - -\n\n## **West Coast v Greater Western Sydney**\n\nWest Coast are highly reliable as a big favourite in Perth, as we discuss every second week.\n\nThey cover at 63% when favoured by more than two goals in WA. They have covered six of their last seven. West Coast have covered 11 of 16 off a win of 30-plus. \n\nGWS were embarrassed by the Swans and the Eagles have covered 8 of the last 10 against the Giants. \n\n## **Recommended Bet:**\n\nWest Coast -18.5\n\n- - -\n\n## **Collingwood vs North Melbourne**\n\nNorth Melbourne will be well and truly up and about after nearly rolling the high-flying Lions last week. \n\nCollingwood have lost three of their last five with their two wins against the struggling Swans and the hapless Crows. The Magpies cover at just 43% when favoured and just 38% when favoured by more than two goals. \n\nNorth have covered 12 of 18 when an underdog of more than two goals. \n\n## **Recommended Bet:**\n\nNorth Melbourne +15.5\n\n- - -\n\n## **2020 Results: AFL Picks**\n\n20 winners from 36 bets.\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 12**\n\n* Bulldogs -3.45 **WIN**\n* West Coast -27.5 **WIN**\n* Geelong +4.5 **WIN**\n\n- - -\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 11**\n\n* Richmond -2.5 **LOSS**\n* West Coast -19.5 **WIN**\n* North Melbourne +10.5 **LOSS**\n\n- - -\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 10**\n\n* GWS -14.5 **LOSS**\n* Melbourne -14.5 **WIN**\n* Collingwood -16.5 **LOSS**\n\n- - -\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 9**\n\n* Sydney+13.5 **LOSS**\n* Carlton -10.5 **LOSS**\n* Essendon +15.5 **LOSS**\n\n- - -\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 8**\n\n* Sydney+6.5 **WIN**\n* West Coast **\\-**5.5 **WIN**\n* Fremantle +10.5 **LOSS**\n\n- - -\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 7**\n\n* Geelong +4.5 **LOSS**\n* North Melbourne +15.5 **LOSS**\n* Carlton +15.5 **WIN**\n\n- - -\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 6**\n\n* Geelong +5.5 **WIN**\n* West Coast -30.5 **WIN**\n* Carlton +11.5 **WIN**\n\n- - -\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 5**\n\n* Carlton +8.5 **LOSS**\n* Essendon +17.5 **WIN**\n* North Melbourne +6.5 **LOSS**\n\n- - -\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 4**\n\n* Sydney +3.5 **LOSS**\n* Collingwood -6.5 **LOSS**\n* North Melbourne +7.5 **WIN**\n\n- - -\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 3**\n\n* Richmond -14.5 **LOSS**\n* Sydney +9.5 **WIN**\n* Carlton +28.5 **WIN**\n\n- - -\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 2**\n\n* Collingwood +7.5 **WIN**\n* Geelong -10.5 **WIN**\n* Carlton +12.5 **WIN**\n\n- - -\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 1**\n\n* West Coast -19.5 **WIN**\n* Carlton +19.5 **LOSS**\n* Fremantle +15.5 **WIN**",
