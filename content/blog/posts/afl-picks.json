He's been winning on Aussie Rules for a decade.\n\nEach week he shares his best three bets at the spread. Get them early as the line almost always moves in his favor.\n\n- - -\n\n## **AFL Picks Round 8**\n\n## **Sydney vs Hawthorn**\n\nIt is incredibly difficult to come into Hawthorn here as favorites. \n\nThe Hawks have dropped all three since shifting to Sydney with all losses coming by 32-plus. \n\nSydney have struggled this year with three losses at the SCG but those losses have all come to teams with a winning record. \n\nThe Swans won both games against teams with a losing record. \n\n### **Recommended Bet:**\n\nSydney +6.5\n\n- - -\n\n## **West Coast vs Collingwood**\n\nVery keen on the Eagles now they are back playing in Perth. \n\nThey were super in annihilating the Dockers by five goals last week. They have now won three on the trot with all three wins coming by more than five goals. \n\nWest Coast have a tremendous record against Collingwood with seven covers in the last 10 meetings, they are a standout play. \n\n### **Recommended Bet:**\n\nWest Coast -5.5\n\n- - -\n\n## **Fremantle vs Geelong**\n\nThe Dockers play the Cats particularly well from a betting perspective and look an outstanding bet with the game being played in WA. \n\nFremantle have covered 9 of the last 12 meetings with Geelong including three of the last four in Perth. Geelong cover at just 41% when favored by 10 or more points. \n\nThe Dockers have just two losses this year by more than 13 points.\n\n### **Recommended Bet:**\n\nFremantle +10.5\n\n- - -\n\n## **2020 Results**\n\nOur guru is 13 from 21 so far this year. Insane results. Hopefully not great variance and he can win at 10%+ when the season finishes.\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 7**\n\n* Geelong +4.5 **LOSS**\n* North Melbourne +15.5 **LOSS**\n* Carlton +15.5 **WIN**\n\n- - -\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 6**\n\n* Geelong +5.5 **WIN**\n* West Coast -30.5 **WIN**\n* Carlton +11.5 **WIN**\n\n- - -\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 5**\n\n* Carlton +8.5 **LOSS**\n* Essendon +17.5 **WIN**\n* North Melbourne +6.5 **LOSS**\n\n- - -\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 4**\n\n* Sydney +3.5 **LOSS**\n* Collingwood -6.5 **LOSS**\n* North Melbourne +7.5 **WIN**\n\n- - -\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 3**\n\n* Richmond -14.5 **LOSS**\n* Sydney +9.5 **WIN**\n* Carlton +28.5 **WIN**\n\n- - -\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 2**\n\n* Collingwood +7.5 **WIN**\n* Geelong -10.5 **WIN**\n* Carlton +12.5 **WIN**\n\n- - -\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 1**\n\n* West Coast -19.5 **WIN**\n* Carlton +19.5 **LOSS**\n* Fremantle +15.5 **WIN**",
