  "body": "Each week we share **AFL Picks** from a profitable sports bettor in Australia.\n\nOur provider, who works anonomously because of contractual agreements, has been winning on his AFL picks for ten years. His custom database focuses on trends, agnostic of player changes.\n\nUnless there has been some late player news, you'll notice the line movements shifting towards his recommendations, a sign of his sharpness.\n\nMost importantly, he **won at 13% profit on turnover in 2019**. Despite a recent cold patch (see results below), he's 17 from 33. Two from his last nine bets has really humbled an electric start to the Covid impacted season.\n\nHe's gets out hard earned money each week and we look forward to his profitability returning to 10%+. \n\n- - -\n\n## **AFL Picks Round 12**\n\n## **Geelong vs Port Adelaide**\n\nGeelong are always a good bet as an underdog, so they look an outstanding play here.\n\nThe Cats cover at 59% when an outsider and have covered 10 of their last 15. As an interstate underdog, Geelong cover at 71%. \n\nThe Cats have won 8 of their last 10 against Port and can continue that strong run this week. \n\n### **Recommended Bet:**\n\nGeelong +4.5\n\n- - -\n\n## Western Bulldogs v Adelaide\n\nThe Crows are an absolute mess at present. They are winless in 11 games. They have covered the start just once this year. They have not broken 60 points since Round 1. They have conceded 129 more points than the next worst defensive side. \n\nThe Bulldogs have lost their last three but they were against the top two teams and the defending premiers. This could get ugly. \n\n## **Recommended Bet:**\n\nWestern Bulldogs -34.5\n\n- - -\n\n## **West Coast v Hawthorn**\n\nThis is a magnificent spot for West Coast, who have a remarkable record as a big favorite in Perth. The Eagles cover at 63% when favored by more than two goals and 69% when favored by more than four goals. \n\nThe Hawks have just a single win in their last six and were exceptionally poor against Freo. \n\n## **Recommended Bet:**\n\nWest Coast -27.5\n\n- - -\n\n## **2020 Results**\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 11**\n\n* Richmond -2.5 **LOSS**\n* West Coast -19.5 **WIN**\n* North Melbourne +10.5 **LOSS**\n\n- - -\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 10**\n\n* GWS -14.5 **LOSS**\n* Melbourne -14.5 **WIN**\n* Collingwood -16.5 **LOSS**\n\n- - -\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 9**\n\n* Sydney+13.5 **LOSS**\n* Carlton -10.5 **LOSS**\n* Essendon +15.5 **LOSS**\n\n- - -\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 8**\n\n* Sydney+6.5 **WIN**\n* West Coast **\\-**5.5 **WIN**\n* Fremantle +10.5 **LOSS**\n\n- - -\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 7**\n\n* Geelong +4.5 **LOSS**\n* North Melbourne +15.5 **LOSS**\n* Carlton +15.5 **WIN**\n\n- - -\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 6**\n\n* Geelong +5.5 **WIN**\n* West Coast -30.5 **WIN**\n* Carlton +11.5 **WIN**\n\n- - -\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 5**\n\n* Carlton +8.5 **LOSS**\n* Essendon +17.5 **WIN**\n* North Melbourne +6.5 **LOSS**\n\n- - -\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 4**\n\n* Sydney +3.5 **LOSS**\n* Collingwood -6.5 **LOSS**\n* North Melbourne +7.5 **WIN**\n\n- - -\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 3**\n\n* Richmond -14.5 **LOSS**\n* Sydney +9.5 **WIN**\n* Carlton +28.5 **WIN**\n\n- - -\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 2**\n\n* Collingwood +7.5 **WIN**\n* Geelong -10.5 **WIN**\n* Carlton +12.5 **WIN**\n\n- - -\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 1**\n\n* West Coast -19.5 **WIN**\n* Carlton +19.5 **LOSS**\n* Fremantle +15.5 **WIN**",
