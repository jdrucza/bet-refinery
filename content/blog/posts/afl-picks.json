  "body": "Our man's AFL Picks went 3 from 3 last week! 12 from 18 on the season so far is incredibly profitable punting. \n\nIf you want AFL Picks every week, for free, from a profitable sports bettor, you have to bookmark this page. \n\nFresh from Australia, our expert (who works at a sportsbook in Australia) won at 13% last year. He's been winning on Aussie Rules for a decade.\n\nEach week he shares his best three bets at the spread. Get them early as the line almost always moves in his favor.\n\n- - -\n\n## **AFL Picks Round 6**\n\n## **Geelong vs Collingwood**\n\nThe Cats are a tremendous bet as an outsider this week … again. \n\nThis match, naturally, takes place in WA. Geelong make the nut at a rate of 61% as an underdog since 2012, while they have covered 10 of 14 as an interstate outsider so travel poses no issue. \n\nCollingwood are poor favorites, covering at just 43% when starting odds-on. As a favorite off a win of five or more goals the Magpies are 12-22 ATS. \n\nGeelong should be favored in this one. \n\n### **Recommended Bet:**\n\nGeelong +4.5\n\n- - -\n\n## **Richmond vs North Melbourne**\n\nRichmond have a horrendous record against North Melbourne and the thinking is history will repeat itself again here. \n\nThe Roos have won seven of the last 10 meetings with eight covers over that run including the last two meetings. \n\nNorth cover at a clip of 60% when an outsider of more than a goal.\n\n### **Recommended Bet:**\n\nNorth Melbourne +15.5\n\n- - -\n\n## **Carlton vs Western Bulldogs**\n\nThe Carlton plus a play … who would have thought. \n\nThe Blues cover at 58% as a double digit outsider and have covered six of their last nine off a win. The Blues have covered four of the last five against Port with three straight wins. \n\nPort have covered just six of 18 off a win of three of more goals. \n\nCarlton can be bet with confidence again. \n\n### **Recommended Bet:**\n\nCarlton +15.5\n\n- - -\n\n## **2020 Results**\n\nOur guru is 12 from 18 so far this year. Insane results. Hopefully not great variance and he can win at 10%+ when the season finishes.\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 6**\n\n* Geelong +5.5 **WIN**\n* West Coast -30.5 **WIN**\n* Carlton +11.5 **WIN**\n\n- - -\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 5**\n\n* Carlton +8.5 **LOSS**\n* Essendon +17.5 **WIN**\n* North Melbourne +6.5 **LOSS**\n\n- - -\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 4**\n\n* Sydney +3.5 **LOSS**\n* Collingwood -6.5 **LOSS**\n* North Melbourne +7.5 **WIN**\n\n- - -\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 3**\n\n* Richmond -14.5 **LOSS**\n* Sydney +9.5 **WIN**\n* Carlton +28.5 **WIN**\n\n- - -\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 2**\n\n* Collingwood +7.5 **WIN**\n* Geelong -10.5 **WIN**\n* Carlton +12.5 **WIN**\n\n- - -\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 1**\n\n* West Coast -19.5 **WIN**\n* Carlton +19.5 **LOSS**\n* Fremantle +15.5 **WIN**",
