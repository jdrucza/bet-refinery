A beautifully positive ROI.\n\nFresh from Australia, our expert (who works at a sportsbook in Australia) has been winning on Aussie Rules for a decade.\n\nEach week he shares his best three bets at the spread. Get them early as the line almost always moves in his favor.\n\n- - -\n\n## **AFL Picks Round 9**\n\n## **Carlton vs Hawthorn**\n\nCarlton have historically played Hawthorn well from a betting perspective with six covers in their last eight meetings. Plus they're playing in notably better form than a Hawthorn outfit that have put their most successful ever coach under pressure.\n\nThe Blues have covered three straight and have made the nut in seven of their last nine night games. The Hawks have failed to cover their last five as an underdog. They have not covered in six of their last seven. \n\n### **Recommended Bet:**\n\nCarlton +10.5\n\n- - -\n\n## **Essendon vs Brisbane**\n\nEssendon are highly reliable plays as an underdog. \n\nThe Bombers cover at 63% when getting more than two goals while they are 16-8 against the spread getting more than two goals off a win. \n\nBrisbane have lost just twice this year but have failed to cover their last three against the Bombers.\n\n### **Recommended Bet:**\n\nEssendon +15.5\n\n- - -\n\n## **St Kilda vs Sydney**\n\nThe Saints are poor favorites. \n\nThey cover at just 43% when the elect in betting and at a poor 39% when favored by double digits. When favored by 10 or more points off a win the Saints have covered just 3 of 13. \n\nThe Swans have covered 11 of their last 16 as an underdog and seven of nine getting double digits.\n\n### **Recommended Bet:**\n\nSydney +13.5\n\n- - -\n\n## **2020 Results**\n\nOur guru is 15 from 24 so far this year.
