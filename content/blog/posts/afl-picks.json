He had a cold week nine, but we're ok with that. His 20%+ ROI was unsustainable and we anticipate him finishing the season in the 7-15% range. Which is incredible, but realistic.\n\nFresh from Australia, our expert (who works at a sportsbook in Australia) has been winning on Aussie Rules for a decade.\n\nEach week he shares his best three bets at the spread. Get them early as the line almost always moves in his favor.\n\n- - -\n\n## **AFL Picks Round 10**\n\n## **Adelaide vs Melbourne**\n\nThe lowly Crows are just a pure bet against team this year. \n\nThey have failed to win any of their first nine games. They have covered just one. They have a lowly percentage of 56.7. \n\nMelbourne are 3-5 but have won two of their last four. The Demons have covered seven of their last eight against the Crows and the Demons have covered four of their last six off a loss of 30-plus.\n\n### **Recommended Bet:**\n\nMelbourne -14.5\n\n- - -\n\n## **Collingwood vs Sydney**\n\nCollingwood will be looking to bounce back after a very disappointing loss following their coach being caught in a biosecurity breach that has rocked the club. \n\nThey will be looking to put that disappointing loss behind them in a very winnable affair against the Swans. \n\nThe Magpies have covered five of the last seven against the Swans. Plus, they've covered 12 of 18 off a loss. The Swans have won just 1 of their last 6 with four losses of 28-plus in that run.\n\n### **Recommended Bet:**\n\nCollingwood -16.5\n\n- - -\n\n## **Essendon vs GWS**\n\nGWS have a nice record against Essendon and can record a big win this week when the teams meet at Metricon. \n\nThe Giants have won four of the last five meetings and have covered six of nine against the Bombers dating back to 2012. \n\nEssendonâ€™s only won in their last three was an unconvincing one against Adelaide. \n\nGWS have won their last two and four of their last six.\n\n### **Recommended Bet:**\n\nGWS -14.5\n\n- - -\n\n## **2020 Results**\n\nOur guru is 15 from 27 so far this year. Insane results. \n\n### **AFL Picks Round 9**\n\n* Sydney+13.5 **LOSS**\n* Carlton -10.5 **LOSS**\n* Essendon +15.5 **LOSS**\n\n- - -\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 8**\n\n* Sydney+6.5 **WIN**\n* West Coast **\\-**5.5 **WIN**\n* Fremantle +10.5 **LOSS**\n\n- - -\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 7**\n\n* Geelong +4.5 **LOSS**\n* North Melbourne +15.5 **LOSS**\n* Carlton +15.5 **WIN**\n\n- - -\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 6**\n\n* Geelong +5.5 **WIN**\n* West Coast -30.5 **WIN**\n* Carlton +11.5 **WIN**\n\n- - -\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 5**\n\n* Carlton +8.5 **LOSS**\n* Essendon +17.5 **WIN**\n* North Melbourne +6.5 **LOSS**\n\n- - -\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 4**\n\n* Sydney +3.5 **LOSS**\n* Collingwood -6.5 **LOSS**\n* North Melbourne +7.5 **WIN**\n\n- - -\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 3**\n\n* Richmond -14.5 **LOSS**\n* Sydney +9.5 **WIN**\n* Carlton +28.5 **WIN**\n\n- - -\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 2**\n\n* Collingwood +7.5 **WIN**\n* Geelong -10.5 **WIN**\n* Carlton +12.5 **WIN**\n\n- - -\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 1**\n\n* West Coast -19.5 **WIN**\n* Carlton +19.5 **LOSS**\n* Fremantle +15.5 **WIN**",
