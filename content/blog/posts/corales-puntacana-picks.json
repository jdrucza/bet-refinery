  "body": "Our eyes light up when a week PGA Tour field, so we can't wait to see what the Golf Model finds as **Corales Puntacana picks**.\n\nYou probably haven't even heard of the favorite, **Will Zalatoris**. \n\n***Spoiler alert: we're backing him.***\n\nPlus a few others. There's lots of value on Tour this week.\n\nSo keep reading this python prediction for Puntanca piece and you'll find:\n\n* Our Golf Model outputs for the win market\n* Outputs vs the market (where's the value?)\n* Final Corales Puntacana picks\n\n- - -\n\n## **2020 Corales Puntacana Outputs**\n\n<div name=\"brtable\" data-file-name=\"tournamentPredictionsCorales.json\" height=\"400px\"></div>\n\nNext step is comparing these outputs vs the market. \n\nUntil our odds comparison is ready, we use **[Odds Checker](https://www.oddschecker.com/us/golf/corales-puntacana-resort-and-club-championship/winner)**. \n\n- - -\n\n## **Corales Puntacana Picks**\n\nAs we've aluded. A weak field can make for plenty of overlays. And we're spoilt for choice this week.\n\nHere are the names that stand out as value:\n\n* Will 'Galifianakis' Zalatoris\n* Henrik Stenson\n* James Hahn\n* Kevin 'Dave' Chappelll\n* Vaughn Taylor\n* Sam Burns\n* Adam Long\n\nAnd the guys that are under the odds (not valued by our Model vs the market):\n\n* Kristoffer 'The Body' Ventura\n* Will 'Flash' Gordon\n\nNow we need to temper that enthusiasm and find the biggest value.\n\nFirstly, the favorite is over the odds. DraftKings are betting 16-1 but the model is two rolls under. So back **Will Zalatoris** if you can get the right odds. 15-1 or higher.\n\n**Henrik Stenson** shouldn't be 40-1 on BetMGM, so we'll eat that up. \n\nHe's missed the cut a few times recently but he was beating all the big boys less than a year ago when he beat Rahm and Reed in a playoff for the Hero World Challenge.\n\nNamed after an average Australian beer, **James Hahn**, will get our cash too. \n\n90-1 at Bet365 is a bet.\n\n**Kevin Chappell**. Or incorrectly pronounced, Kevin 'Dave' Chappelle, is value too. 100-1 with BetMGM but 85-1 on the model.\n\nHe struggles to challenge the big guys, making the cut most tournaments but not the top 20, but he should thrive on the weaker field.\n\n## **Final Picks**\n\n* **1.5 units on Will Zalatoris** at 15-1 or better\n* **1 unit on James Hahn** at 90-1 Bet365\n* **1 unit on Kevin Chappell** at 100-1 **BetMGM**\n\n- - -\n\n## **Why Should I Care About Your Model?**\n\nGlad you asked.\n\nFirstly, our chief data scientist is no joke. He makes a healthy living by betting off his sports models. \n\nHis most recent, our golf model, uses the last 15 years of data to produce win predictions for PGA tournaments. The model can be broken down into three stages:\n\n1. **Historic score adjustment** \n\n   Firstly, historic golf scores are adjusted to account for varying course difficulty and conditions on the day. For example a \"-2\" on a certain course/day combination may be an average score but on another course/day combination it might be a great score due to the course being more difficult and/or unfavorable conditions. This adjustment is necessary so that we can compare players on a like for like basis.\n2. **Score prediction** \n\n   We then create features using the adjusted historic scores and run a few machine learning algorithms on top of these, weighting each equally. These provide an accurate prediction for the most likely score that a player will achieve on an average course in the future.\n3. **Simulation**\n\n   Using these future score predictions, for a given tournament we can then simulate each player's score using their own score distribution to come up with win percentages and fair odds for each player in a tournament.\n\n- - -\n\n<div class=\"predictIt\">\n\n### As an American, you can bet on the US Election.
