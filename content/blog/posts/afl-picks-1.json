  "body": "One of the biggest sporting events in Australia is on this weekend so let's find out what our expert is sharing for **AFL Grand Final Picks**.\n\nFor those AFL rookies, this is a rare year.\n\nCovid-19 has meant the AFL season has been played away from Melbourne. With the Grand Final always taking place at the MCG in front of 100,000 fans.\n\nThis year, the match is played at night, in Brisbane. Away from the local fans of Richmond and Geelong. But these powerful clubs will still fill the Gabba with energy on Saturday night (Aus time).\n\nAdditionally, Richmond are chasing history as they seek their third flag in four years. Something that would put them up there with the best teams of the modern era. Equivalent to a 49ers team in the 80s or a Cowboys in the 90s. I don't think the Brady Patriots have a comparison in the AFL.\n\nGeelong, however, are one of those historically strong teams too. A powerhouse franchise used to success. So\n\n- - -\n\n## **Richmond vs Geelong**\n\nRichmond defeated Geelong just once between 2001 and the 2017 finals but since then the Tigers have gone on to win two premierships and over that run and have defeated the Cats in five of six. Among those wins were a 51-point victory in the 2017 qualifying final and a 19-point triumph in last year’s preliminary final. The Tigers were comfortable winners when the teams met in Round 17.\n\nRichmond go into this with a major advantage over the Cats and should be able to keep the upper hand off a highly impressive preliminary finals win against Port. The Tigers have won eight of nine with seven of those by double digits. The Cats cover at just 41% off a win of 40-plus. The Tigers project as significant value in this one as a favourite of anything short of 9.5 points.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Norm Smith Medal (Finals MVP)**\n\nWhen you get to know us more you'll see that we rarely like favorites. The value is normally lies deeper in the market.\n\nBut we just can't resist **Dustin Martin**. \n\nRichmond have one true superstar. He already has a Brownlow Medal (MVP) and two Norm Smith Medals. He has the game breaking ability (and tattoo / haircut combination) to completely stand out in the biggest games.\n\nWe're with Dusty.\n\nBut if you want bigger odds on a Richmond player (it almost always goes to the winning side), then Shai Bolton looks the value pick. He’s in very good form, slick conditions will suit him to find plenty of the ball, he can sneak forward to impact the scoreboard and in what is shaping up to be a tug of war, he could be the difference. He looks great odds at 20-1.\n\n- - -\n\n## **AFL Grand Final Picks**\n\n* Richmond Moneyline\n* Dustin Martin Norm Smith Medal",
