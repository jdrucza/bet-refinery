Which reflects the sportsbook margins and also our Model's accuracy. \n\nHowever, this week, one betting opportunity screams out. And we've got a few other beauties that have us excited too.\n\nIf you're curious what makes our Model tick, scroll to the bottom of the page. Just know that it was developed by a wildly successful professional punter.\n\nSo it's definitely worth paying attention to the model's BMW Championship Picks.\n\n- - -\n\n## **BMW Championship Predictions**\n\n<div name=\"brtable\" data-file-name=\"tournamentPredictionsBMWChampionship.json\" height=\"400px\"></div>\n\nNext step is comparing these outputs vs the market. \n\nUntil our odds comparison API is on Bet Refinery, we use **[Odds Checker](https://www.oddschecker.com/us/golf/bmw-championship/winner)**. \\\nAs we'll always tell you, it's imperative to shop for the best odds. You NEED multiple betting accounts for that reason.\n\nOk, onto the Picks that stood out.\n\n- - -\n\n## **BMW Championship Picks**\n\nFirstly, **Xander Schauffele** is the second best player in the world right now. According to OUR World Golf Rankings.\n\nFor the BMW, the model has him as the fourth most suited player to the Olympia Fields Country Club.\n\nHe is a 5.59% chance of winning this weekend, so we'll take the +1800 at FanDuel and BetMGM.\n\nNext up, there's an overlay for our Aussie compatriot, **Adam Scott**.\n\nHe's +4500 with most books, when he shouldn't be bigger than +4000. That's a tidy overs bet. We got ya Scotty.\n\nAnd then, our clickbaity heading is our blockbuster bet. \n\nThe Kuch.\n\n**Matt Kuchar** should be +6700, you can get nearly twice that! FanDuel, we hitting you hard.\n\n- - -\n\n### **Final PGA Championship Picks**\n\n* **Xander Schauffele: 1 unit at 18-1** with FanDuel or BetMGM[](https://www.playsugarhocuse.com/?btag=a_3460b_303c_&siteid=3460)\n* **Adam Scott: 1 unit at 45-1** with PointsBet or **[SugarHouse](https://www.playsugarhocuse.com/?btag=a_3460b_303c_&siteid=3460)**\n* **Matt Kuchar: 0.5 units at 120-1** with Fanduel\n\n- - -\n\n## **Full Model Outputs**\n\n![BMW Championship Picks](/images/uploads/2020-bmw-championship-picks-bet-refinery-matt-kuchar-adam-scott-xander.png \"BMW Championship Picks\")\n\n## **Why Should I Care About Your Model?**\n\nGlad you asked.\n\nFirstly, our chief data scientist is no joke. He makes a healthy living by betting off his sports models. \n\nHis most recent, our golf model, uses the last 15 years of data to produce win predictions for PGA tournaments. The model can be broken down into three stages:\n\n1. **Historic score adjustment** \n\n   Firstly, historic golf scores are adjusted to account for varying course difficulty and conditions on the day. For example a \"-2\" on a certain course/day combination may be an average score but on another course/day combination it might be a great score due to the course being more difficult and/or unfavorable conditions. This adjustment is necessary so that we can compare players on a like for like basis.\n2. **Score prediction** \n\n   We then create features using the adjusted historic scores and run a few machine learning algorithms on top of these, weighting each equally. These provide an accurate prediction for the most likely score that a player will achieve on an average course in the future.\n3. **Simulation**\n\n   Using these future score predictions, for a given tournament we can then simulate each player's score using their own score distribution to come up with win percentages and fair odds for each player in a tournament.\n\n- - -\n\n## **More Golf Betting Expertise**\n\nIf you love betting on golf like us, check out our **[Top 50 World Golf Rankings](https://www.betrefinery.com/golf-betting/world-golf-rankings)**.
