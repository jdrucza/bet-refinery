  "body": "The PGA Superbowl is upon us so let's look at the **Masters odds** and see what betting value our expert golf model has found.\n\nWe've run the Model before the Houston Open. So the following tips reflect the value right now. We'll include those tips next week as well, but we'll run the Model with the final field too.\n\nYou can never have too many bets can you*?\n\n\n\n\\*actually you can. \n\n- - -\n\n## **Masters Odds & Predictions**\n\nPrior to the Houston Open and confirmation of the final field, here's our Model's 2020 Masters odds predictions:\n\n<div name=\"brtable\" data-file-name=\"tournamentPredictionsMasters.json\" height=\"400px\"></div>\n\nSo where is the value this week? \n\nWe'll tell you in the next paragraph.\n\n- - -\n\n## **2020 Masters Picks**\n\nWe're very tempted to back **Xander Schauffele**. He's the best golfer in the world according to our Model. And he's a tiny overlay at Fanduel (15-1 vs 14-1).\n\nBut there's juicier overlays around.\n\n**Patrick Cantlay**. We love him. Should be 25-1, he's 30-1.\n\n**Webb Simpson**. Another beast that the Model loves in 2020. You can get 33-1 at Fanduel, when the Model makes him the eighth best player in the field, and 28-1. \n\n- - -\n\n## **Why Should I Care About Your Model?**\n\nGlad you asked.\n\nFirstly, our chief data scientist is no joke. He makes a healthy living by betting off his sports models. \n\nHis most recent, our golf model, uses the last 15 years of data to produce win predictions for PGA tournaments. The model can be broken down into three stages:\n\n1. **Historic score adjustment** \n\n   Firstly, historic golf scores are adjusted to account for varying course difficulty and conditions on the day. For example a \"-2\" on a certain course/day combination may be an average score but on another course/day combination it might be a great score due to the course being more difficult and/or unfavorable conditions. This adjustment is necessary so that we can compare players on a like for like basis.\n2. **Score prediction** \n\n   We then create features using the adjusted historic scores and run a few machine learning algorithms on top of these, weighting each equally. These provide an accurate prediction for the most likely score that a player will achieve on an average course in the future.\n3. **Simulation**\n\n   Using these future score predictions, for a given tournament we can then simulate each player's score using their own score distribution to come up with win percentages and fair odds for each player in a tournament.\n\n- - -\n\n## **More Golf Betting Expertise**\n\nIf you love betting on golf like us, check out our **[Top 50 World Golf Rankings](https://www.betrefinery.com/golf-betting/world-golf-rankings)**.
