  "body": "With March Madness behind us, the betting world is ready for Augusta, and that means examining the **2021 Masters odds** from two perspectives. The sportsbooks and our Golf Model.\n\nOur Model, which we go into more detail on down the bottom, was developed by one of the sharpest sports betting data scientists in the world.\n\nIn this article, we'll share:\n\n* Who suits Augusta\n* The Masters Odds\n* The Predictions from our PGA Model\n* Where the betting value is\n* Who we're backing to win the 2021 Masters\n* What props we're betting on too\n\nAll your betting needs are covered, using the most up to date data sources and a sharp betting model.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Augusta Angles**\n\nBefore we share the models picks, here's the Course Fit Tool from DataGolf to remind you who suits Augusta:\n\n![the masters odds course fit tool](/images/uploads/screen-shot-2021-03-12-at-3.14.22-pm.png \"the masters odds course fit tool\")\n\nWhen you put the relative importance filter on, you're asking for a strong short game, good irons, and big driving. Basically the total package.\n\nBut you can see that if you're off with the stick and the wedge, you won't be wearing green on Sunday.\n\n- - -\n\n## **2021 Masters Odds**\n\nAs you'll soon see, odds are everything.\n\nWe look for value when we bet. Which is players that are much shorter on our Golf Model than the sportsbooks. The greater the difference in odds, the better the bet.\n\nWhat stands out at The Masters, is that sportsbooks opinions vary. And if you shop around for the top odds, you can make a case to back multiple players at great odds. \n\nWe'll share those shortly, but take a look at the Top 16 players, and how their odds vary:\n\n![masters odds 2021](/images/uploads/masters-odds-2021.png \"masters odds 2021\")\n\nWhy 16 players? Well, we were tight for room, and wanted to include Webb Simpson. We recommended Webb at 40-1 weeks ago and you can still see the same odds.\n\n- - -\n\n## **2021 Masters Predictions**\n\nFinally, let's examine the predictions from our Golf Model:\n\n<div name=\"brtable\" data-file-name=\"tournamentPredictionsMasters2021.json\" height=\"400px\"></div>\n\nSo where is the value this week? \n\nWell we compare it to [Odds Boom](https://www.oddsboom.com/golf/futures/1990-masters/) for the US sportsbook prices.\n\n- - -\n\n<div class=\"predictIt\">\n\n**<a href=\"http://join.pointsbet.com/betrefinery-2rf/?utm_source=Unbounce_BetRefinery&utm_medium=Digital_Affiliate_CPA&utm_campaign=Risk_Free_2_500_1000_BetRefinery&utm_term=Unbounce&utm_content=BetRefinery&promo=REFINERY\" target=\"_blank\">WANT GREAT GOLF ODDS? JOIN POINTSBET</a>**\n\n</div>\n\n- - -\n\n## **2021 Masters Picks**\n\nAs you can see from the outputs, we have the defending champ on top.\n\n**DJ**, the ice cold killer, is under the odds though. Under $10 in this field is hard to swallow.\n\nAnd as much as it scares us to bet around him, we have to.\n\n**Bryson**, similarly, is under the odds.\n\nMuch easier to cheer against the big biceps though.\n\nThe Model, as usual, loves the look of some familiar names.\n\n**Jonny Rahm**, **Xander**, **Cantlay** and **Webb Simpson**.\n\nPainfully, it found similar blokes last year.\n\nBut we ride or die with the Model. Developed by one of the sharpest sports betting data scientists on the planet, we stay true.\n\nAnd as Augusta in April approaches, I think we'll line up on the four horseman above.\n\n**One guy we are definitely backing now is Webb Simpson.**\n\n**He's 40-1.** \n\nThat's just too big for a top 10 golfer.\n\nSo back Webb and keep coming back as the tournament gets closer.\n\n- - -\n\n<div class=\"predictIt\">\n\n**<a href=\"http://join.pointsbet.com/betrefinery-2rf/?utm_source=Unbounce_BetRefinery&utm_medium=Digital_Affiliate_CPA&utm_campaign=Risk_Free_2_500_1000_BetRefinery&utm_term=Unbounce&utm_content=BetRefinery&promo=REFINERY\" target=\"_blank\">WANT GREAT GOLF ODDS? JOIN POINTSBET</a>**\n\n</div>\n\n- - -\n\n## **2020 Masters Picks**\n\nWe didn't find DJ. \n\nDammit.\n\nHere are the five men we circled. Plus we had some prop bets which did ok, but in total, a losing event.\n\n(our 1 unit is $100)\n\n* **Xander Schaufelle** to win at 15-1 for 2 units\n* **Webb Simpson** to win at 33-1 for 1 unit\n* **Patrick Cantlay** to win at 28-1 or higher for 1 unit\n* **Matt Kuchar** to win at 170-1 for 0.3 units\n* **Gary Woodland** to win at 170-1 for 0.3 units.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Why Should I Care About Your Model?**\n\nGlad you asked.\n\nFirstly, our chief data scientist is no joke. He makes a healthy living by betting off his sports models. \n\nHis most recent, our golf model, uses the last 15 years of data to produce win predictions for PGA tournaments. The model can be broken down into three stages:\n\n1. **Historic score adjustment** \n\n   Firstly, historic golf scores are adjusted to account for varying course difficulty and conditions on the day. For example a \"-2\" on a certain course/day combination may be an average score but on another course/day combination it might be a great score due to the course being more difficult and/or unfavorable conditions. This adjustment is necessary so that we can compare players on a like for like basis.\n2. **Score prediction** \n\n   We then create features using the adjusted historic scores and run a few machine learning algorithms on top of these, weighting each equally. These provide an accurate prediction for the most likely score that a player will achieve on an average course in the future.\n3. **Simulation**\n\n   Using these future score predictions, for a given tournament we can then simulate each player's score using their own score distribution to come up with win percentages and fair odds for each player in a tournament.\n\n- - -\n\n## **More Golf Betting Expertise**\n\nIf you love betting on golf like us, check out our **[Top 50 World Golf Rankings](https://www.betrefinery.com/golf-betting/world-golf-rankings)**.
