  "body": "With March Madness behind us, the betting world is ready for Augusta, and that means examining the **2021 Masters odds** from two perspectives. The sportsbooks and our Golf Model.\n\nOur Model, which we go into more detail on down the bottom, was developed by one of the sharpest sports betting data scientists in the world.\n\nIn this article, we'll share:\n\n* Who suits Augusta\n* The Masters Odds\n* The Predictions from our PGA Model\n* Where the betting value is\n* Who we're backing to win the 2021 Masters\n* What props we're betting on too\n\nAll your betting needs are covered, using the most up to date data sources and a sharp betting model.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Augusta Angles**\n\nBefore we share the models picks, here's the Course Fit Tool from DataGolf to remind you who suits Augusta:\n\n![the masters odds course fit tool](/images/uploads/screen-shot-2021-03-12-at-3.14.22-pm.png \"the masters odds course fit tool\")\n\nWhen you put the relative importance filter on, you're asking for a strong short game, good irons, and big driving. Basically the total package.\n\nBut you can see that if you're off with the stick and the wedge, you won't be wearing green on Sunday.\n\n- - -\n\n## **2021 Masters Odds**\n\nAs you'll soon see, odds are everything.\n\nWe look for value when we bet. Which is players that are much shorter on our Golf Model than the sportsbooks. The greater the difference in odds, the better the bet.\n\nWhat stands out at The Masters, is that sportsbooks opinions vary. And if you shop around for the top odds, you can make a case to back multiple players at great odds. \n\nWe'll share those shortly, but take a look at the Top 16 players, and how their odds vary:\n\n![masters odds 2021](/images/uploads/masters-odds-2021.png \"masters odds 2021\")\n\nWhy 16 players? Well, we were tight for room, and wanted to include Webb Simpson. We recommended Webb at 40-1 weeks ago and you can still see the same odds.\n\n- - -\n\n## **2021 Masters Predictions**\n\nFinally, let's examine the predictions from our Golf Model:\n\n<div name=\"brtable\" data-file-name=\"tournamentPredictionsMasters2021.json\" height=\"400px\"></div>\n\nSo where is the value this week? \n\nWell we compare it to [Odds Boom](https://www.oddsboom.com/golf/futures/1990-masters/) for the US sportsbook prices.\n\n- - -\n\n<div class=\"predictIt\">\n\n**<a href=\"http://join.pointsbet.com/betrefinery-2rf/?utm_source=Unbounce_BetRefinery&utm_medium=Digital_Affiliate_CPA&utm_campaign=Risk_Free_2_500_1000_BetRefinery&utm_term=Unbounce&utm_content=BetRefinery&promo=REFINERY\" target=\"_blank\">WANT THE BEST ODDS FOR THE MASTERS? JOIN POINTSBET</a>**\n\n</div>\n\n- - -\n\n## **2021 Masters Picks**\n\nAs you can see from the outputs, the Model has Jon Rahm on top. Narrowly ahead of the defending champion, **Dustin Johnson**.\n\nFirst thing to note, the Model doesn't realise that big Roger Rahmjet had a kid this week. \n\nNow, will he play with the freedom of a man with higher priorities or will he play like a sleep deprived foreign father away from his wife and son?\n\nCaesars is betting the latter as they have him the best odds in the world, at +1400.\n\nThat's a bet according to our Model. \n\nLooking at the other favorites, you may have noticed the Model doesn't quite rate DJ as high as the sportsbooks. And the Model isn't buying **Speeeeef** tickets, despite the incredible comeback form.\n\n**Bryson and JT**, are similarly under the odds.\n\nThe Model, as usual, loves the look of some familiar names, beyond Rahm.\n\n**Xander Schauffele**, **Patrick Cantlay** and **Webb Simpson**.\n\nPainfully, it found similar blokes last year.\n\nBut we ride or die with the Model. Developed by one of the sharpest sports betting data scientists on the planet, we stay true.\n\nLets examine the full list of players that are over the market odds and provide value bets (favorite bets in **bold**):\n\n* Jon Rahm (11-1 Model vs 14-1 Caesars)\n* Xander Schauffele (21-1 Model vs 26-1 Unibet / DraftKings)\n* Patrick Cantlay (21-1 Model vs 22-1 William Hill / FoxBet / PointsBet)\n* Webb Simpson (24-1 Model vs 40-1 PointsBet / FoxBet)\n* Patrick Reed (34-1 Model vs 40-1 FoxBet)\n* Tony Finau (34-1 Model vs 40-1 FoxBet / PointsBet)\n* Hideki Matsuyama (49-1 vs 60-1 PointsBet)\n* Matthew Fitzpatrick (47-1 vs 60-1 FoxBet)\n* Scottie Scheffler (54-1 vs 60-1 FoxBet / PointsBet)\n* Tyrrell Hatton (55-1 vs 60-1 FoxBet / PointsBet)\n* Adam Scott (69-1 vs 80-1 FoxBet)\n* Louis Oosthuizen (63-1 vs 90-1 FanDuel)\n* Abraham Ancer (79-1 vs 125-1 Caesars)\n* Corey Conners (81-1 vs 125-1 PointsBet / FoxBet)\n* Justin Rose (90-1 vs 125-1 PointsBet)\n* Billy Horschel (105-1 vs 125-1 PointsBet / FoxBet)\n* Shane Lowry (120-1 vs 175-1 FoxBet)\n\nNow that's a tonne of bets.\n\nIf you love any of these guys, the Model supports you. Just shop for best odds as indicated.\n\nBut we're going to throw another lense over these picks.\n\nWe'll compare the market and model outputs to Betfair. That way we get wisdom of the crowds and the wisdom of market moving, sharp sports bettors.\n\nThe players that Betfair also likes, from above are:\n\n* Jon Rahm\n* Patrick Reed\n* Matthew Fitzpatrick\n* Tyrrell Hatton\n\n- - -\n\n## **Final 2021 Masters Picks**\n\nAll said and done, here are our final WIN bets for the 2021 Masters:\n\n* **Jon Rahm 2 units at 14-1 w/Caesars**\n* **Webb Simpson 1 unit at 40-1 w/FoxBet**\n* **Patrick Reed 1 unit at 40-1 w/FoxBet**\n* **Matthew Fitzpatrick 0.5 units at 60-1 w/FoxBet**\n* **Corey Conners 0.3 units at 125-1 w/PointsBet or FoxBet**\n\nLet's also pick off some prop bets.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Prop Bets**\n\nWith the props, we're going to find group matchups when the Ratings from the Model are wildly different than the market. Specifically, we're going to find players that the market loves, that the Model doesn't.\n\nThe perfect example is **Jordan Spieth**. \n\nAgain, we absolutely love his comeback momentum but we're happy to bet against someone that just lifted a massive monkey off their back. Plus, history is with the Model as only two players have gone on to win a Masters after winning the weekend prior. \n\nWe'll back against Spieth in two tournament matchups:\n\n* 1 unit Jon Rahm at +105 at FoxBet\n* 2 units Justin Thomas -142 at FanDuel\n\nWe're also going to take on **Bryson**. \n\n* 2 units on DJ to beat Bryson -110 at FoxBet\n* 1 unit Justin Thomas +100 at Bet365\n\nNervously, we'll back Xander vs **Brooks** too. Xander is twice as likely to win the Masters as Brooks, according to the Model:\n\n* 1.5 units on Xander to beat Brooks at -111 at FoxBet\n\n**Top Senior: Fred Couples**\n\nGreat bet at +750 for 2 units.\n\nLefty is a deserving favorite but -110 is just under the odds and Fred can still play.\n\n**Top English: Tyrrell Hatton** \n\nBet365 for 2 units at +600.\n\nModel has him as good as any of the other Poms but great price sticking out at 365.\n\n**Top Aussie: Adam Scott**\n\nCam Smith could seriously shock the world and win the whole thing but Scotty is the value here. Just behind Cam on the prediction list but +335 with Unibet or SugarHouse. That's a bet for 2 units.\n\nThat's it ladies and gentlemen. \n\nBet well and enjoy the show.\n\n- - -\n\n<div class=\"predictIt\">\n\n**<a href=\"http://join.pointsbet.com/betrefinery-2rf/?utm_source=Unbounce_BetRefinery&utm_medium=Digital_Affiliate_CPA&utm_campaign=Risk_Free_2_500_1000_BetRefinery&utm_term=Unbounce&utm_content=BetRefinery&promo=REFINERY\" target=\"_blank\">WANT THE BEST ODDS FOR THE MASTERS? YOU NEED POINTSBET</a>**\n\n</div>\n\n- - -\n\n## **Why Should I Care About Your Model?**\n\nGlad you asked.\n\nFirstly, our chief data scientist is no joke. He makes a healthy living by betting off his sports models. \n\nHis most recent, our golf model, uses the last 15 years of data to produce win predictions for PGA tournaments. The model can be broken down into three stages:\n\n1. **Historic score adjustment** \n\n   Firstly, historic golf scores are adjusted to account for varying course difficulty and conditions on the day. For example a \"-2\" on a certain course/day combination may be an average score but on another course/day combination it might be a great score due to the course being more difficult and/or unfavorable conditions. This adjustment is necessary so that we can compare players on a like for like basis.\n2. **Score prediction** \n\n   We then create features using the adjusted historic scores and run a few machine learning algorithms on top of these, weighting each equally. These provide an accurate prediction for the most likely score that a player will achieve on an average course in the future.\n3. **Simulation**\n\n   Using these future score predictions, for a given tournament we can then simulate each player's score using their own score distribution to come up with win percentages and fair odds for each player in a tournament.\n\n- - -\n\n## **More Golf Betting Expertise**\n\nIf you love betting on golf like us, check out our **[Top 50 World Golf Rankings](https://www.betrefinery.com/golf-betting/world-golf-rankings)**.
