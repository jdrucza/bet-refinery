  "body": "The golfing mecca is upon us so let's look at the 2020 Masters odds from two perspectives. The sportsbooks and our Golf Model.\n\nOur Model, which we go into more detail on down the bottom, was developed by one of the sharpest sports betting data scientists in the world.\n\nIn this article, we'll share:\n\n* The winning predictions from our Model\n* How that compares to the market\n* Who we're backing to win the 2020 Masters\n* Head to head betting matchups\n* Group betting matchups\n\nAll your betting needs are covered, using the most up to date data sources and a sharp betting Model.\n\nWithout further ado, what are The Masters odds and who are we betting on?\n\n- - -\n\n## **Augusta Angles**\n\nBefore we share the Models picks, here's the Course Fit Tool from DataGolf to remind you who suits Augusta:\n\n![the masters odds course fit tool](/images/uploads/datagolf-course-fit-tool-the-masters-odds-2020.png \"the masters odds course fit tool\")\n\n- - -\n\nYou can see why Jordan Spieth used to dominate the track before he forgot how to put.\n\nAnd you can see why DJ and Bryson will be very popular this week.\n\nNow let's see what the Model predicts.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Masters Odds & Predictions**\n\nHere are the predictions from our expert Golf Model:\n\n<div name=\"brtable\" data-file-name=\"tournamentPredictionsMasters.json\" height=\"400px\"></div>\n\nSo where is the value this week? \n\nWell we compare it to [Oddschecker](https://www.oddschecker.com/us/golf/the-masters/2020-us-masters/winner) for the US sportsbook prices.\n\n- - -\n\n## **2020 Masters Picks**\n\nMoving on, we actually ran the Model last week, before the Houston Open, to see if we could find some early value. \n\nWe recommended **Webb Simpson** and **Patrick Cantlay**. These two Americans are ranked sixth and eighth, respectively, on our sports betting **[World Golf Rankings](https://www.betrefinery.com/golf-betting/world-golf-rankings)**. \n\nWe're very happy to be on both for The Masters.\n\nSimpson is 33-1 at FanDuel and 30-1 at most sportsbooks. That's higher than his true probability according to our Model.\n\nCantlay, unfortunately, has shortened in price. We got him at 30-1. If you can get 28-1 or higher, bet him too. Maybe you have an odds boost to catch the price we took?\n\n## **What About The Favourites?**\n\nWe're very tempted to back **Xander Schauffele**. He's our favorite golfer of 2020 and is often ranked as the **[best golfer in the world](https://www.betrefinery.com/golf-betting/world-golf-rankings)** according to our Model. \n\nHe finished second last year and should have won, plus he's top five in Scrambling, Par 5 Performance and Bogey Avoidance. \n\nXander is also a tiny overlay at FanDuel (15-1 vs 14-1).\n\nWe're on him.\n\nLet's look at the other big names:\n\n* **Rahm** is 11-1 with the Sportsbooks (S) vs 12-1 with our Model (M)\n* **DJ** is 12-1 (S) vs 12-1 (M)\n* **DeChambeau** is 8-1 (S) vs 15-1 (M)\n* **McIlroy** is 13-1 (S) vs 17-1 (M)\n* **JT** is 14-1 (S) vs 14-1 (M)\n* **Brooks** is 18-1 (S) vs 28-1 (M)\n* **Tiger is** 40-1 (S) vs 66-1 (M)\n\nSo DeChambeau, Brooks and Tiger are too short. And so is Rory, to a lesser extent.\n\n## **Any Other Longshots?**\n\nGreat question.\n\nA couple of players are nearly value (**Hideki Matsuyama** and **Adam Scott**) but we're going deeper.\n\nAll the way down at 170-1 with FanDuel is **Matt Kuchar** and **Gary Woodland**.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Final 2020 Masters Picks**\n\n(our unit is $100)\n\n* **Xander Schaufelle** to win at 15-1 for 2 units\n* **Webb Simpson** to win at 33-1 for 1 unit\n* **Patrick Cantlay** to win at 28-1 or higher for 1 unit\n* **Matt Kuchar** to win at 170-1 for 0.3 units\n* **Gary Woodland** to win at 170-1 for 0.3 units.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Why Should I Care About Your Model?**\n\nGlad you asked.\n\nFirstly, our chief data scientist is no joke. He makes a healthy living by betting off his sports models. \n\nHis most recent, our golf model, uses the last 15 years of data to produce win predictions for PGA tournaments. The model can be broken down into three stages:\n\n1. **Historic score adjustment** \n\n   Firstly, historic golf scores are adjusted to account for varying course difficulty and conditions on the day. For example a \"-2\" on a certain course/day combination may be an average score but on another course/day combination it might be a great score due to the course being more difficult and/or unfavorable conditions. This adjustment is necessary so that we can compare players on a like for like basis.\n2. **Score prediction** \n\n   We then create features using the adjusted historic scores and run a few machine learning algorithms on top of these, weighting each equally. These provide an accurate prediction for the most likely score that a player will achieve on an average course in the future.\n3. **Simulation**\n\n   Using these future score predictions, for a given tournament we can then simulate each player's score using their own score distribution to come up with win percentages and fair odds for each player in a tournament.\n\n- - -\n\n## **More Golf Betting Expertise**\n\nIf you love betting on golf like us, check out our **[Top 50 World Golf Rankings](https://www.betrefinery.com/golf-betting/world-golf-rankings)**.
