The man makes more money from the UFC than most the fighters (you're ruthless Dana White!) and we love following in behind him.\n\n- - -\n\n## Marvin Vettori vs Karl Roberson\n\nThis fight has now been booked what feels like 5 times, albeit cancelled & rescheduled at different junctions due to a combination of injuries, weight-misses, COVID & everything else. But I still feel that it’s a fairly favorable match-up for Vettori in a lot of ways, provided that he takes it upon himself to grapple. Roberson’s been submitted fairly easily every time he’s been granted by a sophisticated grappler, and whilst Vettori might lack the branding of a Glover Teixeira or a Cezar Ferreira, I feel that his grappling game is more than effective enough to make his sub prop a worthwhile play. \n\nIf this ends up being a kickboxing match, I feel that Roberson’s live enough I wouldn’t recommend playing Vettori’s moneyline. My view of this fight is essentially that if Vettori grapples enough to justify his 1.45~ moneyline. There’s a fairly high likelihood that the submission line at 7 looks like a steal. If he ends up getting into a kickboxing match, 1.45’s probably not going to look like an incredible line and therefore I’d rather be sitting on a 7 than on a 1.45 in this junction.\n\n### UFC Fight Night Prediction\n\nVettori by submission\n\n### Betting Strategy\n\n1.5 units on Vettori by Submission @ +550 with Fanduel\n\n- - -\n\n## Christian Aguilera vs Anthony Ivy\n\nThis fight has escaped from the regionals, but there’s a good chance of Aguilera at dog odds being a Genie in a Bottle. Anthony Ivy’s game-plan is… throwing himself at his opponent and attempting to action a series of unusual submissions, something that I feel might get him into dirty spots against a fighter like Aguilera. Whilst Aguilera’s presenting a fairly large question mark in the form of his defensive grappling, as he’s largely avoided grappling exchanges in his last half-decade of tape, I feel that Ivy’s untrustworthy to provide a clinical, strong performance without getting Hurt.\n\nAguilera is no beautiful technician, but at least he’s reliable to come forward and fall in line with his aggressive, punch-swinging gameplan. There is a good chance that his process being to actually do something that functions will leave Ivy with a haunted heart. It’s hard to really recommend a deep play on this fight as it’s what I would usually consider to be a low-level coin-flip, but there ain’t no other man I’d take apart from Aguilera. His lack of grappling tape also might conceal that he keeps getting better, and is hiding significant change in his ability to deal with grappling.\n\n### UFC Fight Night Prediction\n\nAguilera by KO\n\n### Betting Strategy\n\n1 unit on Aguilera @ +163 with Bet365\n\n- - -\n\n## Jessica Eye vs Cynthia Calvillo\n\nThis should be an interesting bout. Calvillo’s probably got the more immediate upside in the form of a submission win, but I feel that Eye should be the minute winner down the stretch in this one. Calvillo’s a great grappler, but not necessarily a major takedown threat, and lacks a strong depth of game in her striking. Eye’s maybe historically been a bit over-maligned, especially after starting her UFC career 2-5 at Bantamweight, but it should also be considered that this is a woman who fought at Straw-weight for years, versus one that was maybe a little bit small to make it at Bantamweight.\n\nSo in a 25 minute WMMA fight, I’ll usually lean the minute-winning fighter to take a decision. Calvillo’s also never been an especially incredible offensive wrestler, and Eye is fairly hard to control.\n\n### UFC Fight Night Prediction\n\nEye by Decision 49-46\n\n### Betting Strategy\n\n2 units on Jessica Eye @ -106 with Fanduel",
