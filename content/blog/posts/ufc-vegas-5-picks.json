But he’s the top five gatekeepers at Middleweight for a reason. His recent career progression, to rounding out his skill set and starting to actually win minutes is also rather encouraging. Even if I miss the boyish charm of what I would dub as ‘Rabies Brunson’ from before he had any skillset beyond charging forward throwing bombs.\n\nBrunson’s an elite athletic specimen, has actually developed some reasonable striking tools in recent years, and has 100% takedown defense under the UFC banner. As such, I feel that there is a fairly-strong possibility that this fight takes place on the feet. This trails into the question of Edmen Shahbazyan, who at this point in his MMA career is a pretty glaring mystery.\n\nHe’s only left the first round once in his career, in his razor-thin bout against Darren Stewart, who scared him away from striking with his huge power, but has essentially nil takedown defense. His other victories have largely been explosive wompings of over-matched regional-level mediocrities, and a fairly low-paced kickboxing match into an early KO against Brad Tavares.\n\nSo it’s a pretty big question of exactly how good Edmen is. I’d say he hasn’t really raised any red flags, but he also hasn’t really done anything that establishes him as a profoundly strong talent. Quick KOs happen, he’s clearly a good athlete, but he’s facing a man in Derek Brunson who also once strung together 4 KO1s in a row in the UFC.\n\nSo neither’s lacking for power, and that alone makes the 1.33 pricepoint somewhat dubious. If Edmen comes out like a house on fire, Brunson will likely respond in kind, and in the proverbial ‘swing to death’ match I don’t think that Edmen can be sensibly priced at 1.33.\n\nIf the fight goes longer than 2-3 minutes of striking, Edmen’s depth of game, cardio, and defense are all mysteries. I don’t think he’s got an A+ chin based on how Stewart rattled him, but there’s just a big inherent volatility here. I am happy to take a poke to find out whether he’s really an elite enough talent to justify the price.\n\n#### **Method of Victory**\n\nSwing to Death Round 1\n\n### **Betting Picks**\n\nBack Brunson to Win for 1.5 units at +230\n\n- - -\n\n### **Randy Brown vs Vincente Luque**\n\nVincente Luque is an incredible offensive talent, boasting fight-ending potential in just about every part of his game, but he has the defensive integrity of a WhatsApp Security Guard. \n\nHe’s historically gotten by on winning insane carnage decisions, scoring late knockouts and otherwise burning the midnight oil on how much punishment he can take before he eventually outlasts his opponents.\n\nThis style took him into ranked contention, though I feel that after four brutal wars out of his last five outings, that he’s starting to slow down. In his recent rematch against Niko Price he looked reasonably gun-shy on the lead, conceding minutes to local meme merchant Niko Price before winning on an injury stoppage in the final minutes.\n\nI think that’s indicative of Luque starting to become rather gun-shy, as his historically-incredible chin has, in my opinion, declined from absolutely bulletproof to merely ‘good’, which has coupled with a certain denting to his self-confidence. Luque’s historically done his best when his opponents are willing to stand in front of him and just trade relentless offensive output.\n\nWhich brings us to Randy Brown, who’s recently had something of a career renaissance as part of developing a startling new strategy in which he avoids his opponents’ offensive output. He’s an ultra-lengthy striker, but in their recent bouts with Bryan Barbarena, he was able to actually stick-and-move effectively to a late third-round KO.\n\nIn Vincente Luque’s fight with Barbarena, he also scored a third-round KO, but Luque absorbed 169 significant strikes in 14 minutes whilst Brown only absorbed 47 significant strikes in 12.5 minutes. Which is a pretty clear contrast of their defensive strategies.\n\nI feel that Brown will be evasive in this fight, and Luque’s lost enough of his willingness to absorb damage in order to apply the sort of ceaseless pressure he’ll likely need in order to track down Randy Brown.\n\nBrown’s fragile enough that he could definitely be caught in a single moment of violence, but I feel he should be the overwhelming minute winner as Luque having absorbed 529 significant strikes in the last 18 months of his life seems to be catching up with him.\n\n#### **Method of Victory**\n\nBrown by decision\n\n#### **Betting Pick**\n\nBack Brown to Win for 2 units at +160\n\n- - -\n\n## **UFC Betting Guide**\n\nWant to learn how to win more with your UFC bets?\n\nRead our **[Ultimate Guide on UFC Betting](https://www.betrefinery.com/blog/bet-on-the-ufc/)**.",
