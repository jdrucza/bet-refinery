Although we bloody love Kevin Durant. The Nets are just a risk at 7-1 when you've got limited depth and your 7 foot scoring machine is coming off an achilles.\n\nHowever, having said that, **[we do like KD for the MVP](https://www.betrefinery.com/nba-betting/nba-mvp-odds)** if Brooklyn do live up to the early market. At 20-1, there's more value there than backing them to win the trophy.\n\nNext up, the Bucks.\n\n**Milwaukee** hit approximately +250 last year and will shorten from 7-1 as the season plays out. According to the season win lines, the Bucks will have the best record in the NBA.\n\nThey have that playoff failing stench that every sports fan is aware of. But that might be reason to zig while everyone zags to Brooklyn. \n\nWhen you look at all the teams in the East, they all have huge question marks. You probably best off locking in the team that will have one of the best records.\n\nFurther down the market, at roughly 20-1, is the **76ers**, **Celtics** and **Heat**. \n\nWe just can't have the Sixers. With or without Harden. Although we do love that Brett Brown has been sacked and Darryl Morey is there.\n\nWe'll likely fall into the Celtics again. Falling for Brad Stevens, Tatum and Brown. But we haven't committed yet.\n\nBig ups to the Heat for their deep run last year but we can't back Jimmy and co right now. \n\n- - -\n\n## **Western Conference**\n\nThe **Lakers** are a dominant favorite to go back to back.\n\nBut +300 is really, really short odds to win the title. You can't possibly back them right now as those odds will be around all season, or better. \n\nThere's an opportunity cost to having your funds locked up. Check BTC growth in 2020 :).\n\nWe're not saying the Lakers don't win but they aren't value at the current quote.\n\nWe're going to fall into our sunken cost team again. The Clippers. \n\nWe're Team Kawhi through and through, and we'll keep supporting Paul George. Plus we love the Serge Ibaka signing, even if they lost Harrell.\n\nBeyond the Clips, the **Mavs** look juicy. Who doesn't want to invest in Luka and have a reason to watch the Mavs run around? There's value there but our preferred roughie is the **Nuggets.** \n\n30-1 is big odds with Jokic on the floor. We love that sytarting five and can see some extra punch coming from Michael Porter Jr. They're always underated too. So we like the Nugs.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Final Picks**\n\nEveryone is off the Bucks and Clips after a weak Playoff showing in the Covid bubble.\n\nAnd when the crowd zigs, we zag. So we're going to keep them onside. Although there is no urgency with buying the Clippers as you know they coast during the regular season.\n\nThe Bucks, however, you want them onside asap.\n\nThe Lakers are way too short and worth considering if any injuries slow down their win rate. And therefore boost that price. You just can't have them at +300 right now.\n\nAs for the roughies, the Mavs and the Nugs look juicy. We also buy a Blazers lottery ticket every year. That's more heart than head but we do love that team when healthy.\n\n* Bucks: 3 units at +700\n* Clips: we'll back them during the season at +700 or higher\n* Nuggets: 2 units at +3000\n* Blazers: 1 unit at +5500\n\n- - -\n\n#### **Want more insight?
