  "body": "## **2020 NBA Championship Odds**\n\nCovid-NBA is in Playoff mode and we're sharing the NBA Championship Odds. Updated live every day.\n\nHere are the NBA Championship Odds from the start of the bubble:\n\n<canvas id='g40' name=\"brgraph\" data-file-name=\"nbaodds.json\" data-only-names=\"Milwaukee Bucks,Los Angeles Clippers,Los Angeles Lakers,Boston Celtics,Toronto Raptors,Houston Rockets,Denver Nuggets,Miami Heat,Portland Trailblazers,Oklahoma City Thunder\" data-start=\"2020-07-31 00:00\" width=\"400\" height=\"150\"></canvas>\n\n- - -\n\n## **Expert Predictions**\n\n### **Eastern Conference**\n\nWe've been backing the Celtics all year. \n\nAverage price 25-1. \n\nKemba Walker back healthy is a big plus. As is the first round injury of our compatriate, Ben Simmons.\n\nWe don't know how they'll get through Giannis (or even Toronto) but this bubble is made for upsets.\n\nWe love the form of Tatum and Brown, and their youthful recovery in this unique set of circumstances. Plus we still believe Brad Stevens is one of the very best coaches in the NBA.\n\nFull transperancy we've had a full 'saver' tickets on the Bucks at +450 during the season. But we're a lot more excited byt the C's and the potential collect.\n\nAgain, this Covid bubble is made for chaos. We see that in the AFL season in Australia and we'd much rather be betting on some of these outsider teams at juicy odds.\n\n- - -\n\n### **Western Conference**\n\nWe're Team Kawhi. \n\nYou saw what he did last year. Why can't he do it for the Clips? They matchup deliciously with the Lakers and they've got the softer draw to the conference finals.\n\nDespite some inconsistencies during the season, we're backing the Clippers to elevate in 2020.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Best Bets**\n\n* Boston Celtics +1600 (Pointsbet)\n* Los Angeles Clippers +315 (Bet America)\n\n- - -\n\n## **NBA Championship Odds 2019/20**\n\nBecause we like sexy graphs, here are the odds from the very start of the season. You'll notice the 76ers, Jazz and Pelicans dropping off after some hype. \n\n<canvas id='g40' name=\"brgraph\" data-file-name=\"nbaodds.json\" data-only-names=\"Milwaukee Bucks,Los Angeles Clippers,Los Angeles Lakers,Boston Celtics,Toronto Raptors,Houston Rockets,Denver Nuggets,Miami Heat,Portland Trailblazers,Oklahoma City Thunder,Philadelphia 76ers,Utah Jazz,Indiana Pacers,New Orleans Pelicans\" data-start=\"2019-10-01 00:00\" width=\"400\" height=\"150\"></canvas>",
