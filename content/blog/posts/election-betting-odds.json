It's unlikely he'll return to favoritism in November but you can bet on the Republican party rallying behind Trump when he is the confirmed candidate.\n\nNext in the market still shocks us. Hilary Clinton. The 2016 runner-up missed her shot at gold in our opinion. And husband Bill hasn't done her any favors on Netflix. \n\nWe shouldn't underestimate the institutional favoritism of the Democratic Party though. After all, their current candidate is 78 years old in November. The exact life expectancy of an American male.\n\nRounding up the field is Mike Richard Pence. His US election odds of 0.6% feel about right.\n\n<canvas id='g3' name=\"brgraph\" data-file-name=\"Election_odds_json.json\" data-only-names=\"Donald Trump,Joe Biden,Hillary Clinton,Mike Pence\" data-start=\"2020-03-01 00:00\" width=\"400\" height=\"150\"></canvas>\n\n- - -\n\n## **2016-2020 Election Betting Odds**\n\nWant to see all of the probability movements since Donald Trump defeated Hilary Clinton?
