But President Trump has some serious adversity with the Covid resurgence and the racial unrest.\n\nHowever, the Donald does have one thing going for him, beyond his loyal base. The NASDAQ has recovered from the Covid collapse, growing year on year. That economic strength is hard to ignore, especially when the index has doubled since he took office. Trump has some big battles to fight but you can see why his 2020 election betting odds have been improving in the last week.\n\nUncle Joe doesn't need to do too much at the moment. He just needs Trump to fail under the immense pressure.\n\nOn the next line of betting is where it gets interesting. Pence is roughly a 1.5% chance. Which makes sense as Vice President.\n\nBut how on earth is Hilary Clinton the fourth most likely president. Her 2020 election betting odds are roughly 80-1. Has no one in the democratic party watched the Epstein doco? \n\nThe fifth favorite is none other than Yeezy. Yes, Kanye West. 150-1. First lady, Kim Kardashian West. \n\nGiven we've backed winners in golf and tennis tournaments at 200-1, a Yesus Presidency is not like a pig flying. It's much more likely than your imagination believes.\n\n<canvas id='g3' name=\"brgraph\" data-file-name=\"Election_odds_json.json\" data-only-names=\"Donald Trump,Joe Biden,Hillary Clinton,Mike Pence,Kanye West\" data-start=\"2020-03-01 00:00\" width=\"400\" height=\"150\"></canvas>\n\n- - -\n\n## **2020 Election Betting Odds**\n\nWant to see all of the probability movements since Donald Trump defeated Hilary Clinton?
