Will he?\n\n<canvas id='g21' name=\"brgraph\" data-file-name=\"FloridaOdds.json\" data-only-names=\"Republicans,Democrats\"  data-colors=\"#0000ff,#ff0000\" data-start=\"2018-01-01 00:00\" width=\"400\" height=\"150\"></canvas>\n\n### **Pennsylvania**\n\nBiden needs to win back the state he was born in for the blue team. 20 Electoral Votes.\n\n<canvas id='g28' name=\"brgraph\" data-file-name=\"PennsylvaniaOdds.json\" data-only-names=\"Republicans,Democrats\"  data-colors=\"#0000ff,#ff0000\" data-start=\"2018-01-01 00:00\" width=\"400\" height=\"150\"></canvas>\n\n### **Arizona**\n\nAnother fascinating battleground state with 11 tickets up for grabs.\n\n<canvas id='g20' name=\"brgraph\" data-file-name=\"ArizonaOdds.json\" data-only-names=\"Republicans,Democrats\"  data-colors=\"#0000ff,#ff0000\" data-start=\"2018-01-01 00:00\" width=\"400\" height=\"150\"></canvas>\n\nAgain, check out our **[Swing States](https://www.betrefinery.com/us-election-betting/swing-states)** page for all of the markets. **[North Carolina](https://www.betrefinery.com/us-election-betting/north-carolina-polls-and-election-betting/)** and **[Ohio](https://www.betrefinery.com/us-election-betting/ohio-polls-and-election-betting)** are fascinating battlegrounds, and it's always good to see what **[Texas](https://www.betrefinery.com/us-election-betting/texas-polls/)** is up to as well.\n\n- - -\n\n<div class=\"predictIt\">\n\n### As an American, you can bet on the US Election.

Then he stormed home, winning the White House in a historic upset.\n\nThat story hasn't been forgotten by anyone. And the polls were even more in Hilary's favor than the betting odds.\n\nHowever, let's not forget, Trump was never a 0% chance at any point. \n\n20% at the start of the night. That's 2 out of 10. \n\nOr 20 out of 100.\n\nThat's about our field goal percentage when we're shooting from NBA 3 point range. There's plenty of airballs and bricks but we'll bank a couple in too.\n\nAs we know, Trump lost the popular vote but he had some incredibly narrow Electoral College wins. \n\n**[Michigan by 0.2%](https://www.betrefinery.com/us-election-betting/michigan-polls-and-election-betting/)**. \n\n**[Pennsylvania by 0.7%](https://www.betrefinery.com/us-election-betting/pennsylvania-polls-and-election-betting/)**.[](https://www.betrefinery.com/us-election-betting/wisconsin-polls-and-election-betting/)\n\n**[Wisconsin by 0.7%](https://www.betrefinery.com/us-election-betting/wisconsin-polls-and-election-betting/)**. \n\nAnd that's how you get the W when you're 4-1 odds.\n\n- - -\n\n<div class=\"predictIt\">\n\n## **But Americans Can’t Bet On It, Can They?**\n\nNot true.\n\nSportsbooks are definitely banned.
