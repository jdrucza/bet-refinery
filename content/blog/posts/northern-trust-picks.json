  "body": "Our powerful Python golf predictor is providing **Northern Trust Picks**. How's that for alliteration?\n\nIt's a strong field at TPC Boston. The gun show, Bryson Dechambeau, is clearly at the top of the market. Above the three best golfers in the world (Rory, JT, Rahm).\n\nWe've put the field into a new golf model and are going to share all the outputs here.\n\nWe'll then compare those with the betting markets. And when we spot value, they'll be our Northern Trust picks to bet on. \n\n- - -\n\n## **Northern Trust Predictions**\n\n<div name=\"brtable\" data-file-name=\"tournamentPredictionsNorthernTrust.json\" height=\"400px\"></div>\n\nAs we said, the next step is comparing those outputs to the sportsbooks. Where is the value and the over-rounds?\n\n- - -\n\nNorthern Trust Picks\n\nUnfortautnely, the model outputs are really similar to the sportsbooks. Particularly as sportsbooks have a little margin built in.\n\nThe only bet that the model marks shorter than our favorite sportsbooks in the US is **Patrick Cantlay**.\n\nWe think he's the seventh best golfer in the world. Above big names like DJ, Koepka, Tiger, Finau, Fleetwood and Day.\n\nSo you'll see him constantly referenced at Bet Refinery. Until his prizemoney starts catching up. Just as it did with **Jon Rahm**. Our previous favorite.\n\nSo we're backing Cantlay for 1 unit at the Northern Trust.\n\nOther model favorites are **Billy Horschel, Gary Woodland, Abraham Ancer** and **Matthew Fitzpatrick**. The market has found them a little bit, but our model likes them more.\n\nSo let's see if there are any prop markets for that trio, or if we can fade Bryson at good odds. We don't think he should be the clear favorite.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Northern Trust Props**\n\nWe're big on **Billy Horschel**.\n\nHe finished second last week and has had a T7 and T13 since the Covid restart.\n\nFor that reason, we love him to finish in the top 10 at TPC Boston.\n\nBet365 and Foxbet are giving us +550. We'll take it.\n\n**Gary Woodland** is another American we like to check out each week. However, Gazza is an all of none guy. He'll either miss the cut or finish at the tail. Or he'll be in the finish.\n\nFor that reason, we're going to spec Woodland in the Top 5 market at +1200. We could go the safer route with top 10 or top 20, but we think the aggresive play suits him better.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Final Northern Trust Picks**\n\n* Patrick Cantlay to win at +3000 with Bet365\n* Billy Horschel Top 10 at +550 with Bet365 and Foxbet\n* Gary Woodland +1200 with SugarHouse\n\n- - -\n\n## **Why Should I Care About Your Model?**\n\nGlad you asked.\n\nFirstly, our chief data scientist is no joke. He makes a healthy living by betting off his sports models.\n\nHis most recent, our golf model, uses the last 15 years of data to produce win predictions for PGA tournaments. The model can be broken down into three stages:\n\n1. **Historic score adjustment**\n\n   Firstly, historic golf scores are adjusted to account for varying course difficulty and conditions on the day. For example a \"-2\" on a certain course/day combination may be an average score but on another course/day combination it might be a great score due to the course being more difficult and/or unfavorable conditions. This adjustment is necessary so that we can compare players on a like for like basis.\n2. **Score prediction**\n\n   We then create features using the adjusted historic scores and run a few machine learning algorithms on top of these, weighting each equally. These provide an accurate prediction for the most likely score that a player will achieve on an average course in the future.\n3. **Simulation**\n\n   Using these future score predictions, for a given tournament we can then simulate each player's score using their own score distribution to come up with win percentages and fair odds for each player in a tournament.\n\n- - -\n\n## **More Golf Betting Expertise**\n\nIf you love betting on golf like us, check out our **[Top 50 World Golf Rankings](https://www.betrefinery.com/golf-betting/world-golf-rankings)**.
