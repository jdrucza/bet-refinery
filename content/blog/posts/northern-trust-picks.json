The gun show, Bryson Dechambeau, is clearly at the top of the market. Above the three best golfers in the world (Rory, JT, Rahm).\n\nWe've put the field into a new golf model and are going to share all the outputs here.\n\nWe'll then compare those with the betting markets. And when we spot value, they'll be our Northern Trust picks to bet on. \n\n- - -\n\n## **Northern Trust Predictions**\n\n<div name=\"brtable\" data-file-name=\"tournamentPredictionsNorthernTrust.json\" height=\"400px\"></div>\n\nAs we said, the next step is comparing those outputs to the sportsbooks. Where is the value and the over-rounds?\n\n- - -\n\n## **2020 Northern Trust Picks**\n\n- - -\n\n## **Why Should I Care About Your Model?**\n\nGlad you asked.\n\nFirstly, our chief data scientist is no joke. He makes a healthy living by betting off his sports models.\n\nHis most recent, our golf model, uses the last 15 years of data to produce win predictions for PGA tournaments. The model can be broken down into three stages:\n\n1. **Historic score adjustment**\n\n   Firstly, historic golf scores are adjusted to account for varying course difficulty and conditions on the day. For example a \"-2\" on a certain course/day combination may be an average score but on another course/day combination it might be a great score due to the course being more difficult and/or unfavorable conditions. This adjustment is necessary so that we can compare players on a like for like basis.\n2. **Score prediction**\n\n   We then create features using the adjusted historic scores and run a few machine learning algorithms on top of these, weighting each equally. These provide an accurate prediction for the most likely score that a player will achieve on an average course in the future.\n3. **Simulation**\n\n   Using these future score predictions, for a given tournament we can then simulate each player's score using their own score distribution to come up with win percentages and fair odds for each player in a tournament.\n\n- - -\n\n## **More Golf Betting Expertise**\n\nIf you love betting on golf like us, check out our **[Top 50 World Golf Rankings](https://www.betrefinery.com/golf-betting/world-golf-rankings)**.
