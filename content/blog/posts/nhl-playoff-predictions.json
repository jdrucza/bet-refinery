And importantly, their odds of winning the Stanley Cup.\n\nThe outputs are very self explanatory. And we highly recommend sniping Stanley Cup futures for the big differences. \n\nThe **[NBA Playoff Predictions Model](https://www.betrefinery.com/nba-betting/nba-playoff-predictions)** spotted the Utah Jazz as Championship contenders when they were 50-1. Same thing with Phoenix at 40-1. \n\nWithout further ado, let's run the numbers.\n\n- - -\n\n## **NHL Playoff Predictions**\n\nWe'll automate this table in the coming weeks. Please excuse the archaic screenshot:\n\n![nhl playoff predictions](/images/uploads/nhl-playoff-predictions-1-april-16.png \"nhl playoff predictions\")\n\n![nhl playoff predictions 2](/images/uploads/nhl-playoff-predictions-2-april-16.png \"nhl playoff predictions 2\")\n\n- - -\n\n<div class=\"predictIt\">\n\nWant **the biggest promos?**\n\nStart with **$2,000** in bonus bets.\n\n**<a href=\"https://join.pointsbet.com/betrefinery-2rf/?utm_source=Unbounce_BetRefinery&utm_medium=Digital_Affiliate_CPA&utm_campaign=Risk_Free_2_500_1000_BetRefinery&utm_term=Unbounce&utm_content=BetRefinery&promo=REFINERY\">JOIN POINTSBET NOW!</a>**\n\n</div>\n\n- - -\n\n## **NHL Futures Interpretation**\n\nLet's start by looking at the best odds from all the sportsbooks, courtesy of Odds Boom.\n\nThis was provided on the 16th of April:\n\n![nhl playoff predictions](/images/uploads/nhl-stanley-cup-odds.png \"nhl playoff predictions\")\n\nThe Avalanche are currently bang on. The Market and Model are aligned. \n\nAnd there isn't much value on the next lines of betting.\n\nWhere there is value is the two teams from New York.\n\nThat's our bets.\n\nThe **Islanders** are 15-1 in the Market and 10-1 with the Model.\n\nAnd the **Rangers** are a huge 75-1 with the Market, and only 21-1 with the Model.\n\n**Nashville** is another team worth specking, if you're a Preds fan. \n\nThe Model is half the odds of the Market.\n\nCanadian fans, there's no value to be found on any of your teams atm.\n\nBut New Yorkers, put your money where your feet are. We'll join you. \n\n- - -\n\n## **More NHL Resources**\n\nWe LOVE betting futures.
