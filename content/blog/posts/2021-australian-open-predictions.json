  "body": "We've built and released our fourth betting Model in 2021, and hopefully, you've been enjoying it throughout the **Australian Open Predictions**.\n\nThis Model, developed by one of the sharpest sports betting data scientists in the industry, ingests dozens of tennis data sources to create probabilities for every tournament. \n\nFrom backyard ATP events to the Grand Slams. It distinguishes surfaces too. So Rafa is going to have a different rating on clay than he is on the Australian Open hardcourt.\n\nWe'll go into further details in the future, but let's stop wasting time and start reading the **Australian Open Predictions**. They'll populate every day of the tournament.\n\nYou'll notice that there can be significant differences of opinion. \n\nLike when Su-Wei Hsieh was rated as the favorite vs Markéta Vondroušová, but the market was +200 ($3.00).\n\nHsieh won in straight sets!\n\nThey don't always go that well but it's one of dozens of examples of why you should be checking our Australian Open Predictions as part of your research.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Australian Open Mens Predictions**\n\nAs you can see, we've just got the head to head probabilities today. We'll expand the basic UX in the coming weeks on our year long Model, the **[Tennis Predictions Today](https://www.betrefinery.com/tennis-betting/tennis-predictions-today)** page. \n\nFor now, we'll populate the picks, and below each table will be some value betting options that stand out.\n\n<div name=\"brtable\" data-api-name=\"tennis_matches\" data-api-param-gender=\"Mens\" data-api-param-date=\"2021-02-15\" data-api-param-tourney-name=\"Australian Open - Melbourne\" data-left-aligned-cols=\"PlayerTwo\" data-except-cols=\"Date\"></div>\n\n- - -\n\n## **Mens Daily Tennis Betting Tips**\n\nThe bet of the day is **Matteo Berrettini** upsetting Stefanos Tsitsipas.\n\nYou can get $4.40 (+340) at different sportsbooks. But the Model makes Matteo a 42.9% chance.\n\nYou could also just take the +4.5 to be safer, but that doesn't feel very big to us. The value is the moneyline.\n\nYou could also trade out and back Tsitsipas if he loses of the first two sets.\n\nIn the other matches, the Model resembles the Market.\n\nHowever, there is value in Mackenzie McDonald (+9.5) and Casper Ruud (+7.5) covering their lines.\n\n- - -\n\n<div class=\"predictIt\">\n\nWant the **best odds on tennis**?\n\n**Join the world's biggest sportsbook.**\n\n**<a href=\"https://www.bet365.com/olp/open-account?affiliate=365_01001096\">JOIN BET365.
