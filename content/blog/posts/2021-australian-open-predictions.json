It distinguishes surfaces. So Rafa is going to have a different rating on clay than he is on the Australian Open hardcourt.\n\nWe'll go into further details in the coming days, but let's stop wasting time and start reading the **Australian Open Predictions**. They'll populate every day of the tournament.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Australian Open Mens Predictions**\n\nAs you can see, we've just got the head to head probabilities today. We'll expand the basic UX in the coming days.\n\nAnd then by the end of the tournament, we should have some pretty sexy outputs. \n\nFor now, we'll populate the picks, and below each table will be some value betting options that stand out.\n\n<div name=\"brtable\" data-api-name=\"tennis_matches\" data-api-param-gender=\"Mens\" data-api-param-date=\"2021-02-14\" data-api-param-tourney-name=\"Australian Open - Melbourne\" data-left-aligned-cols=\"PlayerTwo\" data-except-cols=\"Date\"></div>\n\n- - -\n\n## **Mens Daily Tennis Betting Tips**\n\nThe clearest Men's bet today is:\n\n**Aslan Karatsev** vs Felix Auger Aliassime\n\nKaratsev is rated a 43.63% chance by the Model, but the market is +200 ($3.00).\n\n**Grigor Dimitrov** is shorter on the Model too. So you could back him to upset Thiem or cover.\n\n**Djokovic** is the best price you'll ever see him against Raonic. The Model doesn't realize he is under an injury cloud though.\n\nThat being said, if he takes the court and warms up well, we think he wins easily.\n\nJust check your sportsbook's rules on retiring.\n\n- - -\n\n<div class=\"predictIt\">\n\nWant the **best odds on tennis**?\n\n**Join the world's biggest sportsbook.**\n\n**<a href=\"https://www.bet365.com/olp/open-account?affiliate=365_01001096\">JOIN BET365.

Model makes her favorite, yet she's +200 ($3.00) with the books. That's a brilliant bet.\n\nAnd we love the sportsbook underestimating the world number two. We back Halep at the minus two starts ago, and it won, and we'll go again.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Australian Open Mens Odds**\n\nWe've also got the futures markets, showing you live probabilities of each market.
