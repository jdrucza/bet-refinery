So let's get it going.\n\nThe Model incorrectly predicted Brady as a value bet. She was big odds vs Osaka.\n\nWe've left them up for you to see, as well as their futures price throughout the tournament. \n\n- - -\n\n## **Australian Open Mens Predictions**\n\n<div name=\"brtable\" data-api-name=\"tennis_matches\" data-api-param-gender=\"Mens\" data-api-param-date=\"2021-02-21\" data-api-param-tourney-name=\"Australian Open - Melbourne\" data-left-aligned-cols=\"PlayerTwo\" data-except-cols=\"Date\"></div>\n\nAs you can see, the clear value is with the king of Melbourne Park, and potential tennis goat, **Novak Djokovic**.\n\nWe're expecting a hostile crowd for the Djoker but we have to be on him. The Model is comprehensively in his corner.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Australian Open Mens' Odds**\n\nWe've also got the futures markets, showing you live probabilities of each market. Here's the mens:\n\n<canvas id='g83' name=\"brgraph\" data-file-name=\"ausOpenMensOdds.json\" data-only-names=\"Novak Djokovic,Daniil Medvedev\" data-start=\"2021-02-08 00:00\" width=\"400\" height=\"150\"></canvas>\n\n- - -\n\n<div class=\"predictIt\">\n\nWant the **best odds on tennis**?\n\n**Join the world's biggest sportsbook.**\n\n**<a href=\"https://www.bet365.com/olp/open-account?affiliate=365_01001096\">JOIN BET365.

I expect she'd be a dominant favorite.\n\nBut thankfully, our iRobot says that **Brady is the bet**.\n\nGo you good thing!\n\nModel says she should be +244, not +425.\n\nGotta be honest though, we're scared of Naomi. \n\nSo maybe the +4.5 is the Brady bet.\n\nEither that, or take the +425 and back Osaka in the run.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Australian Open Womens' Odds**\n\n<canvas id='g84' name=\"brgraph\" data-file-name=\"ausOpenWomensOdds.json\" data-only-names=\"Naomi Osaka,Jennifer Brady\" data-start=\"2021-02-08 00:00\" width=\"400\" height=\"150\"></canvas>\n\n- - -\n\n#### **Want tennis predictions all year?
