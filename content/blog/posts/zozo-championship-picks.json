The Jinx.\n\nNevertheless, we'll reshuffle our ZoZo Championship picks but also keep a Scotty angle in play.\n\nYou'll notice in our **[World Golf Rankings](https://www.betrefinery.com/golf-betting/world-golf-rankings)** that Adam Scott is currently the ninth best player in the game. So keep an eye on Scotty for Masters futures. Hoping a few sportsbooks panic on the Covid test and wind the odds out. \n\nNow back to the ZoZo. Let's show off our scrambling and find some value in the market.\n\n- - -\n\n## **2020 ZoZo Championship Outputs**\n\n<div name=\"brtable\" data-file-name=\"tournamentPredictionsZOZO.json\" height=\"400px\"></div>\n\nNext step is comparing these outputs vs the market. \n\nUntil our odds comparison is ready, we use **[Odds Checker](https://www.oddschecker.com/us/golf/the-cj-cup/winner)**. \n\n- - -\n\n## **Final ZoZo Championship Picks**\n\nYou can see the Model is aligned with most of the top of the field.\n\nExcept, it has yet again underestimated **Xander Schauffele**. Long time readers would be sick of us tipping Xander as he has been on our radar for at least two months. We've tipped him as he climbed all the way up the ladder to be the best golfer in the world, according to our Model.\n\nBut you can still back him at 12-1, as the model has him 11-1. \n\nThen if you want to throw a much \n\nThen all the way down, **Matt Kuchar** at 135-1.\n\nKuch hasn't been as hot recently but he had a second at The Genesis earlier in the year and a bunch of top 20s.\n\n* Back Xander with 1.5 units at 12-1.\n* Back Kuchar with 0.3 units at 135-1.\n* Back Kuchar with 2 units at 3-1 for Top 20.\n\n- - -\n\n<div class=\"predictIt\">\n\n**<a href=\"http://join.pointsbet.com/betrefinery-2rf/?utm_source=Unbounce_BetRefinery&utm_medium=Digital_Affiliate_CPA&utm_campaign=Risk_Free_2_500_1000_BetRefinery&utm_term=Unbounce&utm_content=BetRefinery&promo=REFINERY\" target=\"_blank\">WANT GREAT GOLF ODDS?

He makes a healthy living by betting off his sports models. \n\nHis most recent, our golf model, uses the last 15 years of data to produce win predictions for PGA tournaments. The model can be broken down into three stages:\n\n1. **Historic score adjustment** \n\n   Firstly, historic golf scores are adjusted to account for varying course difficulty and conditions on the day. For example a \"-2\" on a certain course/day combination may be an average score but on another course/day combination it might be a great score due to the course being more difficult and/or unfavorable conditions. This adjustment is necessary so that we can compare players on a like for like basis.\n2. **Score prediction** \n\n   We then create features using the adjusted historic scores and run a few machine learning algorithms on top of these, weighting each equally. These provide an accurate prediction for the most likely score that a player will achieve on an average course in the future.\n3. **Simulation**\n\n   Using these future score predictions, for a given tournament we can then simulate each player's score using their own score distribution to come up with win percentages and fair odds for each player in a tournament.\n\n- - -\n\n## **More Golf Betting Expertise**\n\nIf you love betting on golf like us, check out our **[Top 50 World Golf Rankings](https://www.betrefinery.com/golf-betting/world-golf-rankings)**.
