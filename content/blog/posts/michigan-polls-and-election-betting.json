  "body": "You want to know what the **Michigan Polls** are showing for the Presidential Election? \n\nEminem's home state voted red in 2016 by 0.2% (!), but what are the polls showing for 2020?\n\nWho cares. There's a better source of truth than the Michigan polls. It's betting data.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Michigan Election Odds**\n\n<canvas id='g16' name=\"brgraph\" data-file-name=\"MichiganOdds.json\" data-only-names=\"Republicans,Democrats\"  data-colors=\"#0000ff,#ff0000\" data-start=\"2018-01-01 00:00\" width=\"400\" height=\"150\"></canvas>\n\nAs you can see, Michigan is comprehensively Democratic. For now. Which reflects the six elections before Donald Trump vs Hillary Clinton in 2016.
