  "body": "## **2021 NBA Championship Odds**\n\nWe were on the Celtics at yuge odds last year. \n\n26-1. \n\nThey got into +350.\n\nBut why couldn't they show up for the Heat?\n\nAnyway, we'll be going again. We LOVE betting futures. \n\nIn this piece you'll get access to all our futures picks, as well as our sexy graph showing the exact probabilities as the season unfolds.\n\n<canvas id='g91' name=\"brgraph\" data-file-name=\"nbaodds.json\" data-only-names=\"Milwaukee Bucks,Los Angeles Clippers,Los Angeles Lakers,Boston Celtics,Toronto Raptors,Houston Rockets,Denver Nuggets,Miami Heat,Utah Jazz,Indiana Pacers,Portland Trail Blazers\" data-start=\"2020-07-31 00:00\" width=\"400\" height=\"150\"></canvas>\n\n- - -\n\n## **Expert Predictions**\n\n### **Eastern Conference**\n\nThe **Brooklyn Nets** are WAY too short.\n\nTerrible odds at 7-1 to win the chip.\n\nThe culture killing Kyrie Irving plus a 7 foot scoring machine coming off an achilles. With or without James Harden, we'll be confidently betting around them.\n\n**Milwaukee** will shorten again. They hit approximately +250 last year and will shorten from 7-1 as the season plays out.\n\nBut they still have that playoff failing stench, and it's reason to look wider.\n\nNext, at roughly 20-1, is the **76ers**, **Celtics** and **Heat**. \n\nWe just can't have the Sixers. With or without Harden. Although we do love that Brett Brown has been sacked and Darryl Morey is there.\n\nBut we always lean on the Celtics. We'll liekly fall into them again but stay tuned.\n\nBig ups to the Heat for their deep run last year and they do look over the odds again.\n\n- - -\n\n### **Western Conference**\n\nThe **Lakers** are a dominant favorite to go back to back.\n\n+300 is really, really short odds to win the title. You can't possibly back them right now as those odds will be around all season, or better. \n\nThere's an opportunity cost to having your funds locked up. Check BTC growth in 2020 :).\n\nWe're not saying the Lakers don't win but they aren't value at the current quote.\n\nWe fell into the Clips last year but got burnt so can't make a strong case right now. Not with their offseason.\n\nThe **Mavs** look juicy as who doesn't like betting on Luka?\n\nBut the **Nuggets** are the clear value pick for us. 30-1 is big odds.\n\nWe love that sytarting five and can see some extra punch coming from Michael Porter Jr. They're always underated too. We like the Nugs.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Final Picks**\n\nWe haven't pulled the trigger on any futures bets yet.\n\nCan't wait to bet around Brooklyn though.\n\nSome strong teams at 20-1 or better and this Covid-ish season will throw up some strange results. So we'll bet around the favorites early.\n\nCome back before the season starts for the hot mail.\n\n- - -\n\n#### **Want more insight?
