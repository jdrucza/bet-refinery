Where is the value and the over-rounds?\n\nGiven the market and model are so aligned at the top of the market (Simpson, Koepka, Fleetwood, Rose), we need to dig deeper.\n\nThe big standout is actually **Jim Furyk**. He's been playing professional golf as long as we've been breathing but he won a senior tournament two weeks ago and has played in some of the returning PGA events too.\n\nWe're not certain he can win, but we do think he is a **HUGE** price in the Betting W/O Casey, Fleetwood, Koepka, Reed, Simpson market. \n\nHe's +6500 with Fanduel\n\nThats an amzing bet given the model gives him similar odds to win the tournament with those guys in it.\n\nAs well as some real rough picks in:\n\n* Bud Cauley\n* Dylan Fritelli\n* Rory Sabbatini\n* Zach Johnson\n\nBut we're not backing eight guys (although some people would).\n\nLet's narrow our selections.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Why Should I Care About Your Model?**\n\nGlad you asked.\n\nFirstly, our chief data scientist is no joke. He makes a healthy living by betting off his sports models.\n\nHis most recent, our golf model, uses the last 15 years of data to produce win predictions for PGA tournaments. The model can be broken down into three stages:\n\n1. **Historic score adjustment**\n\n   Firstly, historic golf scores are adjusted to account for varying course difficulty and conditions on the day. For example a \"-2\" on a certain course/day combination may be an average score but on another course/day combination it might be a great score due to the course being more difficult and/or unfavorable conditions. This adjustment is necessary so that we can compare players on a like for like basis.\n2. **Score prediction**\n\n   We then create features using the adjusted historic scores and run a few machine learning algorithms on top of these, weighting each equally. These provide an accurate prediction for the most likely score that a player will achieve on an average course in the future.\n3. **Simulation**\n\n   Using these future score predictions, for a given tournament we can then simulate each player's score using their own score distribution to come up with win percentages and fair odds for each player in a tournament.\n\n- - -\n\n## **More Golf Betting Expertise**\n\nIf you love betting on golf like us, check out our **[Top 50 World Golf Rankings](https://www.betrefinery.com/golf-betting/world-golf-rankings)**.
