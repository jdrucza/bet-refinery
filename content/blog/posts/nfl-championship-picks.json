  "body": "Want to know who will be competing for **Superbowl VL**? \n\nWe've got your NFL Championship Picks ahead of a super Sunday.\n\nAnd the man previewing the content, is the same guy that gave us two, and only two, futures picks at the start of the year:\n\n* Bufffalo Bills Superbowl win at 30-1\n* Josh Allen MVP at 33-1\n\nAs Larry David would say, pretty, pretty, pretty good.\n\nNo cigar on either, especially the Allen MVP, but geez it's good betting.\n\nNow, back to the AFC and NFC Championship games. \n\nWhat is he forecasting there?\n\nRead on my friend. Read on.\n\n- - -\n\n## **NFC Championship Preview**\n\n### **Green Bay Packers vs Tampa Bay Buccaneers**\n\nConference Championship round kicks off with the Green Bay Packers hosting the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Bucs were able to hold off the Saints in New Orleans last week in a tight game, while the Packers were able to convincingly beat the LA Rams at home. \n\nThe Tampa Bay offense continued their steak of 30+ point games last week, making it five straight in the 30-20 win. But the offense was far from firing, with all three of their touchdown drives coming off the back of New Orleans turnovers which provided good field position (starting at the opposition 3, 40 and 20 yard lines). Tom Brady didn't have his best game but was able to remain turnover free, committing only one turnover since week 12 and only one interception away from home since week one. With the weather in Green Bay at this time of year usually a big factor, Brady's two decades in New England should prepare him for possible snow and the expected top of 30 degrees fahrenheit (-1c). Brady has a career record of 19-3 in games with a kickoff temperature of 30F or less and has thrown for 300+ yards in his last four of these games. \n\nThe Bucs defense had a huge game last week after struggling to end the season, turning the ball over four times and limiting Drew Brees to 134 yards and three interceptions on a quarterback rating of 38.1. They will be looking to repeat this against Aaron Rodgers, who they held to a similar line of 160 yards, two interceptions and a quarterback rating of 35.4 in their week 6 matchup.In that matchup, the Bucs were able to get at Rodgers often, creating pressure on 29.3% of dropbacks for four sacks and seven QB hits. \n\nRodgers has been nearly perfect since that week six anomaly, with his quarterback rating dropping below 100 just once (91.6 in week 15) on his way to a touchdown:interception ratio of 50:5 and almost certainly his third MVP trophy. With the Bucs typically forcing their opponents to pass with their elite run defense (lowest yards per carry at 3.6 and lowest rushing yards allowed with 1289), this places the league's leader in completion rate (70.7%), adjusted yards gained per attempt (9.6) and quarterback rating (121.5) into a position where he can take over the game. Keeping Rodgers in a clean pocket against a defensive line that tormented him in week six will be key for the Packers, with his completion percentage dropping to 45.3% when under pressure. \n\nThe Packers have been vulnerable on the ground all year, allowing 4.48 yards per carry and continued on this trend in last week's win against the Rams, with rookie running back Cam Akers rushing for 90 yards and a touchdown on 18 carries. The Packers defensive backfield has been their strength this year, but have poor matchups on paper against the Bucs two strongest receivers. Chris Godwin generally works from the slot and will come up against The Packers undrafted slot corner Chandon Sullivun, the weakest of the Packers starting cornerbacks. All-pro corner Jaire Alexander usually matches up against the opposition's best outside receiver, but will have a seven inch, 15 kilo physical disadvantage against the Bucs 6'5 Mike Evans. \n\nWith last week's win against the Saints looking better on paper than it did to the eye, the Bucs could get blown away early with another slow start this week. Rodgers largely looked untroubled last week against the elite defense of the Rams and I'm expecting the same again this week, with Brady and the Bucs struggling to keep up. \n\n### **NFC Championship Pick**\n\n* Packers -3.5 at -105\n\n- - -\n\n## **AFC Championship Preview**\n\n### **Kansas City Chiefs vs Buffalo Bills**\n\nThe Buffalo Bills head to Kansa City to face the Chiefs in their first AFC Championship game since 1994. While this will be the Chiefs third straight trip to the championship game. \n\nThe two matched up earlier in the year, with the Chiefs winning 26-17 in a tight contest.\n\nThe Bills all but abandoned the run in last week's game against the Ravens, even in high winds that made passing difficult, opting to put the ball in Josh Allen's hands as he continued his breakout year. \n\nThat should change this week with the Chiefs in the bottom half for yards per carry allowed (4.5), but even if the game plan remains pass heavy expect to see plenty of the Bills running backs. The Chiefs are allowing the fourth most catches to running backs this year. Allen finished the year in the top five for passing yards (4,544), touchdown passes (37) and QB rushing TD's (8) and will be hoping to perform better than the week six matchup where he put up a season low 122 passing yards and faced pressure on season high 54.8% of his dropbacks. \n\nThe Bills played two high safeties on 68% of the snaps (double the amount of their other games) against the Chiefs in Week 6, inviting them to run and taking the ball out of Patrick Mahomes hands. They obliged, posting a season high to 245 yards on 46 carries. It wouldn't be surprising to see the same approach to start the games, especially with injuries in the Chiefs backfield. Clyde Edwards-Helaire, who ran over the Bills for 161 yards, has been limited in practice and may play his first game since mid December. Le'Veon Bell has been struggling with a knee injury, which thrust third string Darrell Williams into a lead role last week.\n\nAll eyes were on Quarterback Patrick Mahomes this week, who left last week's game with a concussion. While it appears Mahomes has been able to pass the concussion protocol, reports that he is dealing with a turf toe issue that would limit his mobility has surfaced. With the Bills likely to tempt the Chiefs into running the ball again this week, it will be interesting to see if the Chiefs try to protect their quarterback after they ignored similar temptations to run since the Bills game (no team has thrown more first downs than the Chiefs). The Bills defensive scheme usually sets up to limit big plays and they were able to slow big play specialist Tyreek Hill in Week 6 (three catches for 20 yards), but were torched by star tight end Travis Kelce to the tune of five catches, 65 yards and two touchdowns on only seven targets. I'd expect Kelce to be the focal point of the passing attack again this week.\n\nThe Chiefs will look to Week 6 as the blueprint to stop the surging Josh Allen. While they weren't able to record a sack, they blitzed 14 times, creating pressure on 54.8% of dropbacks and forced a season low 51.9% completion rate. The Bills offensive line has improved as the year has gone on and looks a better unit than what was produced in Week 6, but the Chiefs have posted eight sacks in the last three weeks. The Chiefs may also be without cornerbacks Bashaud Breeland (concussion/shoulder) and Rashad Fenton (foot) both limited in practice all week. \n\nWhile the Chiefs haven't lost since Week 5 (removing Week 17's dead rubber), their form leading into the playoffs have raised some questions. Not covering a spread or winning by more than six points since a Week 8 dismantling of the hapless Jets, they have also scored totals of 22, 17 and 22 in their last three games (removing week 17 again). \n\nWith the Bills on a streak of their own, going 11-1 since the Week 6 loss to the Chiefs, with the only loss coming on the \"Hail Murray\" versus Arizona in Week 10. I'm backing the Bills for an upset in a tight contest in Kansas City, with Josh Allen coming out on top of a contest between two of the best quarterbacks in the league. \n\n### **AFC Championship Pick**\n\n* Buffalo Bills to win at +154\n\n- - -\n\n### **Want more insight?
