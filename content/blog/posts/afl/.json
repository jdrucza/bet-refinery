Our expert, who works at a sportsbook in Australia, won at 13% last year. He's been winning on Aussie Rules for a decade.\n\nEach week he shares his best three bets at the spread. Get them early as the line almost always moves in his favour.\n\n- - -\n\n## **AFL Picks Round 5**\n\n## **Carlton v St Kilda**\n\nCarlton getting a start is nearly always a bet and so it is here against St Kilda. The Blues cover at 58% as an underdog and at 61% as an underdog in Melbourne. The Blues have covered two straight against the Saints and seven of the last 10. \n\nSt Kilda are awful favourites, covering at just 42% and making the nut in just 1 of their last 8 when favoured in betting. \n\n### **Recommended Bet:**\n\nCarlton +8.5\n\n- - -\n\n## **Collingwood v Essendon**\n\nEssendon have an outstanding cover record against Collingwood. They have covered nine of 15 against the Magpies including both matches last season. The Bombers have covered five of their last seven as an underdog and cover at 62% when an outsider of more than two goals, a clear indication the market usually gets them wrong. \n\nCollingwood cover at just 39% when favoured by more than two goals. \n\n### **Recommended Bet:**\n\nEssendon +17.5\n\n- - -\n\n## **Western Bulldogs v North Melbourne**\n\nThe Western Bulldogs are poor favourites, covering at just 41% when the popular elect. In their last 17 when favoured in betting, the Bulldogs have covered just five.\n\nThe Kangaroos are in the opposite boat. They cover at 60% when getting more than a goal and 62% when an underdog of more than a goal in Victoria.\n\n### **Recommended Bet:**\n\nNorth Melbourne +6.5\n\n- - -\n\n## **2020 Results**\n\nOur guru is 8 from 12 so far this year. Insane results. Hopefully not great variance and he can win at 10%+ when the season finishes.\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 4**\n\n* Sydney +3.5 **LOSS**\n* Collingwood -6.5 **LOSS**\n* North Melbourne +7.5 **WIN**\n- - -\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 3**\n\n* Richmond -14.5 **LOSS**\n* Sydney +9.5 **WIN**\n* Carlton +28.5 **WIN**\n- - -\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 2**\n\n* Collingwood +7.5 **WIN**\n* Geelong -10.5 **WIN**\n* Carlton +12.5 **WIN**\n- - -\n\n### **AFL Picks Round 1**\n\n* West Coast -19.5 **WIN**\n* Carlton +19.5 **LOSS**\n* Fremantle +15.5 **WIN**",
