Control+F your favorite golfers or just slowly examine the top 50 or so.\n\nIt's a dang strong field. Underneath the table you'll see our commentary about the reining champ and then our betting selections.\n\n<div name=\"brtable\" data-file-name=\"PGAChampionshipPredictions.json\" height=\"400px\"></div>\n\nYou'll notice the quality of our outputs by examining back to back PGA Champion, Brooks Koepka. \n\nThe quarterback looking Floridian is number 20 on our **[World Golf Rankings](https://www.betrefinery.com/golf-betting/world-golf-rankings/)**, suggesting his form makes him the 20th best golfer in the world at the moment. But he elevates himself for the big tournaments, as we all know. \n\nThe model knows that too. Ranking the big fella fifth. Behind JT, Rory, Rahm and Xander.\n\n- - -\n\n## **PGA Championship Picks**\n\nOur next step is comparing the outputs to the betting market. To find value. \n\nUntil we have our own odds comparison technology (coming soon), we'll use **[Oddschecker ](https://www.oddschecker.com/us/golf/uspga/2020-pga-championship/winner)**to compare our outputs to the market. We have to go all the way down to **Adam Scott** to find a standout betting opportunity.\n\nFanduel has Scott at 75-1. We think he should be 55-1. That's a bet.\n\nOther players that stand out are **Billy Horschel** and **Matt Kuchar**.\n\nWe think Horschel is the 22nd best player in the world at the moment, and the model makes him a 90-1 chance to win the PGA Championship. However, he's 125-1 with SugarHouse and DraftKings.\n\nSimilarly, Kuchar is 110-1 with Fanduel, but we mark him a 82-1 chance. That's a bet too.\n\n### **Final PGA Championship Picks**\n\n* **Adam Scott: 1 unit at 75-1 with Fanduel**\n* **Billy Horschel: 0.5 units at 125-1 with [SugarHouse](https://www.playsugarhocuse.com/?btag=a_3460b_303c_&siteid=3460)**\n* **Matt Kuchar: 0.5 units at 110-1 with Fanduel**\n\n- - -\n\n## **Why Should I Care About Your Model?**\n\nGlad you asked.\n\nFirstly, our chief data scientist is no joke. He makes a healthy living by betting off his sports models. \n\nHis most recent, our golf model, uses the last 15 years of data to produce win predictions for PGA tournaments. The model can be broken down into three stages:\n\n1. **Historic score adjustment** \n\n   Firstly, historic golf scores are adjusted to account for varying course difficulty and conditions on the day. For example a \"-2\" on a certain course/day combination may be an average score but on another course/day combination it might be a great score due to the course being more difficult and/or unfavourable conditions. This adjustment is necessary so that we can compare players on a like for like basis.\n2. **Score prediction** \n\n   We then create features using the adjusted historic scores and run a few machine learning algorithms on top of these, weighting each equally. These provide an accurate prediction for the most likely score that a player will achieve on an average course in the future.\n3. **Simulation**\n\n   Using these future score predictions, for a given tournament we can then simulate each player's score using their own score distribution to come up with win percentages and fair odds for each player in a tournament.\n\nHere's the Python outputs for our top 50 PGA Championship Picks:\n\n![2020 pga championship picks bet refinery](/images/uploads/pga-champion-picks-python-bet-refinery.png \"2020 pga championship picks - bet refinery\")\n\n- - -\n\n## **More Golf Betting Expertise**\n\nIf you love betting on golf like us, check out our **[Top 50 World Golf Rankings](https://www.betrefinery.com/golf-betting/world-golf-rankings)**.
