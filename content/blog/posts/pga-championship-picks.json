And what a spectacular track. Absolutely picturesque. \n\nBut let's not waste any more time. Let's check out the Model's outputs for the 2021 PGA Championship.\n\n- - -\n\n## **2021 PGA Championship Predictions**\n\nWithout further ado, we've listed each player on our fancy table with their fair odds, set to a 100% market. Control+F your favorite golfers or just slowly examine the top 50 or so.\n\nIt's a dang strong field. Underneath the table you'll see our commentary and picks.\n\n<div name=\"brtable\" data-file-name=\"tournamentPredictionsPGAChampionship2021.json\" height=\"400px\"></div>\n\n- - -\n\n## **PGA Championship Picks**\n\nBy now, we know where to look when the outputs roll out.\n\nThe Model loves Rahm, but he's not value. \n\nThe Model will fade Jordan Spieth and look beyond the always underpriced big names: Rory, Bryson, DJ. Brooks. \n\nHard to knock those five, but the Model has his preferred stable.\n\nAnd two stand out again. \n\n**Webb Simpson**.\n\n**Patrick Cantlay**.\n\nThey're often shorter on the Model. Webb partiocularly catches your eye, as he is the 7th most liekly winner in the field. Yet you can get 45-1 for him.\n\nCantlay is very rarely 50-1, so that's a bet too.\n\nNext up is **Abraham Ancer**. We love the smooth moving Mexican. 60-1 with Caesars.\n\nJoaquin Niemann is a bet too. \n\nSo that's our four horseman for the PGA Championship in 2021.\n\n## **Final PGA Championship Picks**\n\n* **Webb Simpson - 1 unit at 45-1**\n* **Patrick Cantlay - 0.75 units at 50-1**\n* **Abraham Ancer - 0.6 units at 60-1**\n* **Joaquin Niemann - 0.4 units at 70-1**\n\n- - -\n\n## **Why Should I Care About Your Model?**\n\nGlad you asked.\n\nFirstly, our chief data scientist is no joke. He makes a healthy living by betting off his sports models. \n\nHis most recent, our golf model, uses the last 15 years of data to produce win predictions for PGA tournaments. The model can be broken down into three stages:\n\n1. **Historic score adjustment** \n\n   Firstly, historic golf scores are adjusted to account for varying course difficulty and conditions on the day. For example a \"-2\" on a certain course/day combination may be an average score but on another course/day combination it might be a great score due to the course being more difficult and/or unfavorable conditions. This adjustment is necessary so that we can compare players on a like for like basis.\n2. **Score prediction** \n\n   We then create features using the adjusted historic scores and run a few machine learning algorithms on top of these, weighting each equally. These provide an accurate prediction for the most likely score that a player will achieve on an average course in the future.\n3. **Simulation**\n\n   Using these future score predictions, for a given tournament we can then simulate each player's score using their own score distribution to come up with win percentages and fair odds for each player in a tournament.\n\n- - -\n\n## **More Golf Betting Expertise**\n\nIf you love betting on golf like us, check out our **[Top 50 World Golf Rankings](https://www.betrefinery.com/golf-betting/world-golf-rankings)**.
