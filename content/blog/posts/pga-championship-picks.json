  "body": "The market has made a mistake, so we're super excited to share our **2020** **BMW Championship Picks**.\n\nEach week, our Model has been so similar to the market. Which reflects the sportsbook margins and also our Model's accuracy. \n\nHowever, this week, one betting opportunity screams out. And we've got a few other beauties that have us excited too.\n\nIf you're curious what makes our Model tick, scroll to the bottom of the page. Just know that it was developed by a wildly successful professional punter.\n\nSo it's definitely worth paying attention to the model's BMW Championship Picks.\n\n- - -\n\n## **BMW Championship Predictions**\n\n![BMW Championship Picks](/images/uploads/2020-bmw-championship-picks-bet-refinery-matt-kuchar-adam-scott-xander.png \"BMW Championship Picks\")\n\nNext step is comparing these outputs vs the market. \n\nUntil our odds comparison API is on Bet Refinery, we use Odds Checker. \\\nAs we'll always tell you, it's imperitive to shop for the best odds. You NEED multiple accounts.\n\n\n\n- - -\n\n## **PGA Championship Picks**\n\nOur next step is comparing the outputs to the betting market. To find value. \n\nUntil we have our own odds comparison technology (coming soon), we'll use **[Oddschecker](https://www.oddschecker.com/us/golf/uspga/2020-pga-championship/winner)** to compare our outputs to the market. We have to go all the way down to **Adam Scott** to find a standout betting opportunity.\n\nFanduel has Scott at 75-1. We think he should be 55-1. That's a bet.\n\nOther players that stand out are **Billy Horschel** and **Matt Kuchar**.\n\nWe think Horschel is the 22nd best player in the world at the moment, and the model makes him a 90-1 chance to win the PGA Championship. However, he's 125-1 with SugarHouse and DraftKings.\n\nSimilarly, Kuchar is 110-1 with Fanduel, but we mark him a 82-1 chance. That's a bet too.\n\n### **Final PGA Championship Picks**\n\n* **Adam Scott: 1 unit at 75-1 with Fanduel**\n* **Billy Horschel: 0.5 units at 125-1 with [SugarHouse](https://www.playsugarhocuse.com/?btag=a_3460b_303c_&siteid=3460)**\n* **Matt Kuchar: 0.5 units at 110-1 with Fanduel**\n\n- - -\n\n## **Why Should I Care About Your Model?**\n\nGlad you asked.\n\nFirstly, our chief data scientist is no joke. He makes a healthy living by betting off his sports models. \n\nHis most recent, our golf model, uses the last 15 years of data to produce win predictions for PGA tournaments. The model can be broken down into three stages:\n\n1. **Historic score adjustment** \n\n   Firstly, historic golf scores are adjusted to account for varying course difficulty and conditions on the day. For example a \"-2\" on a certain course/day combination may be an average score but on another course/day combination it might be a great score due to the course being more difficult and/or unfavorable conditions. This adjustment is necessary so that we can compare players on a like for like basis.\n2. **Score prediction** \n\n   We then create features using the adjusted historic scores and run a few machine learning algorithms on top of these, weighting each equally. These provide an accurate prediction for the most likely score that a player will achieve on an average course in the future.\n3. **Simulation**\n\n   Using these future score predictions, for a given tournament we can then simulate each player's score using their own score distribution to come up with win percentages and fair odds for each player in a tournament.\n\n- - -\n\n## **More Golf Betting Expertise**\n\nIf you love betting on golf like us, check out our **[Top 50 World Golf Rankings](https://www.betrefinery.com/golf-betting/world-golf-rankings)**.
