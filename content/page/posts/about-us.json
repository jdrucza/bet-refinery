Probably 21-50 years old and living in the US.\n\nAlthough, if you're in India, Germany or Australia etc, you'll still enjoy our content.\n\nYou love sport and bet on it. You'd rather win than lose, and unlike plenty of pickles out there, you like to do a little homework. \n\nYou come to Bet Refinery each day to bounce your bets off our sophisticated betting models. We're your sense check.\n\nOr you just want to know exactly what to bet on with spoon fed expert tips. We got you too.\n\nWe want to give you a community of sport bettors that you can shoot the sh*t with and share your wins with.\n\nNow, onto us. Who are we are and why should you give Bet Refinery any of your scarce attention?\n\n- - -\n\n## **Who Are We?**\n\nBased in Australia but we've got an office in Brooklyn when our Prime Minister lets us travel again.\n\n### **Jason Wong**\n\nOne of our founders, Jason Wong, is one of the world's sharpest sports betting data scientists.\n\nYou can **[read how Jas left his quant position at a bank](https://www.betfair.com.au/hub/the-banker-a-quants-afl-betting-strategy/)**, and successfully modelled a sport he'd never watched!\n\nHe hasn't looked back, turning full time professional in 2016. Meaning his exclusive (and healthy) income has been sports betting.\n\n## **Jonno Lowe**\n\nEqually as sharp, with a lot more time on the court, has been Jonno Lowe. \n\nThe aussie statitician started modeling sport while at University. \n\nHe started with tennis and had people climbing the walls for his outputs, so he opened the paid service **[Sportpunter ](https://www.dailyprofit.com.au/)**in 2003! \n\nTalk about an OG. The man has been living off hig winning models largely ever since and we're so thrilled to share some of those on Bet Refinery.\n\nYou can still sign up for his NBA Totals package **[HERE ](https://www.dailyprofit.com.au/)**though. It's unique to the NBA Predictions Model we have on site. Though ours is also lethal.\n\n### **James McLoughlin**\n\nOne of our other co-founders, JMac, has been betting since 2008.\n\nJMac has worked at all of the biggest sportsbooks in Australia. Including Sportsbet (Fanduel), Betfair, Sportingbet (William Hill) and Betstar (BetMGM).\n\nHe's had his finger on the pulse for over a decade and makes a part time living by finding incorrect pricing on sportsbook websites. He used to bet professionally with automated horse racing models but two kids have slowed the ol' boy down. \n\n- - -\n\nHere's a slightly pixelated Zoom interview between James and Jas, on behalf of Betfair:\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8WBKqn6-lqM\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n- - -\n\n## **Our Models**\n\nWhat seperates us from EVERY OTHER GAMBLING CONTENT SITE is that we are legitamite winners. We make incomces from this game, which puts us in the 2%.\n\nAnd we even share some of the sports betting models that we use to beat the market.\n\nWe're always adding to our content inventory, but right now, our Models are:\n\n* **[NBA Predictions](https://www.betrefinery.com/nba-betting/nba-predictions)**\n* [](https://www.betrefinery.com/nba-betting/nba-predictions)**[NCAAB Picks](https://www.betrefinery.com/ncaab-betting/free-ncaab-picks)**\n* **[Tennis Predictions](https://www.betrefinery.com/tennis-betting/tennis-predictions-today)**\n* **[Ice Hockey Predictions](https://www.betrefinery.com/nhl-betting/ice-hockey-predictions)**\n* **[Golf Predictions](https://www.betrefinery.com/golf-betting)**",
