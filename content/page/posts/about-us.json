  "body": "## **Who Are You?**\n\nThere's a 96% chance you're a dude. Probably 21-50 years old and living in the US.\n\nAlthough, if you're in India, Europe or Australia etc, you'll still enjoy our elite sports betting models.\n\nYou love sport and enjoy betting on it. Unlike plenty of pickles out there, you like to do a little homework. \n\nYou come to Bet Refinery each day to bounce your bets off our models' outputs.\n\nOr you just want to know exactly what to bet on with spoon fed expert tips. We got you too.\n\nNow, onto us. Who are we are and why should you give Bet Refinery any of your scarce attention?\n\n- - -\n\n## **Who Are We?**\n\nBased in Australia but we've got a space in Brooklyn when our Prime Minister lets us travel again.\n\nOur mission is to share the knowledge that we've accumulated in the last 20 years in Australia. We want to provide betting models across all your favorite sports and we want to teach you some simple tricks to help you win more. Think staking strategies, odds comparisons and bonus bet use.\n\nAnd here's some of the team:\n\n### **Jason Wong**\n\nJas is one of the world's sharpest sports betting data scientists.\n\nYou can **[read how Jas left his quant position at a bank](https://www.betfair.com.au/hub/the-banker-a-quants-afl-betting-strategy/)**, and successfully modelled a sport he'd never watched!\n\nHe hasn't looked back, turning full time professional in 2016. Meaning his exclusive (and healthy) income has been sports betting.\n\nHere's a slightly pixelated Zoom interview between Jason and JMac (below), on behalf of Betfair:\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8WBKqn6-lqM\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n- - -\n\n### **Jonno Lowe**\n\nEqually as sharp, with a lot more time on the court, has been Jonno Lowe. \n\nThe aussie statitician started modeling sport while at University. \n\nHe started with tennis and had people climbing the walls for his outputs, so he opened the paid service **[Sportpunter](https://www.dailyprofit.com.au/)** in 2003! \n\nTalk about an OG. The man has been living off hig winning models largely ever since and we're so thrilled to share some of those on Bet Refinery.\n\nYou can still sign up for his NBA Totals package **[HERE](https://www.dailyprofit.com.au/)** though. It's unique to the NBA Predictions Model we have on site. Though ours is also lethal.\n\nHere's one of several videos with Jonno online, talking about his experience in the game:\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zBU5JA4hl1c\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nYou can also see him discuss the closing lines **[HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4U6EWHUJw)**.\n\n- - -\n\n### **James McLoughlin**\n\nOne of our other co-founders, JMac, has been betting since 2008.\n\nJMac has worked at all of the biggest sportsbooks in Australia. Including Sportsbet (Fanduel), Betfair, Sportingbet (William Hill) and Betstar (BetMGM).\n\nHe first started winning by copying all of the smart bets that hit his employers at the time. Then he stopped working on the bookie side to create an automated sports betting model on horse racing. It was a healthy full time pursuit and he milked the edge until the UK owned businesses closed every account he opened. \n\nHe now bets part time and runs the marketing at Bet Refinery.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Our Models**\n\nWhat seperates us from EVERY OTHER GAMBLING CONTENT SITE is that we are legitamite winners. We make incomces from this game, which puts us in the 2%.\n\nAnd we even share some of the sports betting models that we use to beat the market.\n\nWe're always adding to our content inventory, but right now, our Models are:\n\n* **[NBA Predictions](https://www.betrefinery.com/nba-betting/nba-predictions)**\n* [](https://www.betrefinery.com/nba-betting/nba-predictions)**[NCAAB Picks](https://www.betrefinery.com/ncaab-betting/free-ncaab-picks)**\n* **[Tennis Predictions](https://www.betrefinery.com/tennis-betting/tennis-predictions-today)**\n* **[Ice Hockey Predictions](https://www.betrefinery.com/nhl-betting/ice-hockey-predictions)**\n* **[Golf Predictions](https://www.betrefinery.com/golf-betting)**",
