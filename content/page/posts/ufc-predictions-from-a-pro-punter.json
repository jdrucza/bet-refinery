  "body": "### **145 lbs.:Bryce Mitchell vs. Charles Rosa**\n\nRepresenting Team Daniel Cormier as their second overall pick on The Ultimate Fighter (TUF) 27, Bryce Mitchell (12-0) dispatched Jay Cucciniello in the opening round before succumbing to eventual winner Brad Katona’s submission game. He has since established himself as a top prospect with three Octagon victories, the most recent coming by way of twister ([watch it](https://www.mmamania.com/2019/12/7/21000375/ufc-on-espn-7-full-fight-video-highlights-overeem-rozenstruik-washington-dc-mitchell-twister-sayles)).\n\nHe has submitted eight opponents in the first round and nine overall.\n\nCharles Rosa (12-3) made his Octagon debut way back in 2014, amassing a 2-3 record over the next three years and picking up a trio of “Fight of the Night” bonuses along the way. He ended a 2.5-year layoff in Oct. 2019 with a “[Performance of the Night](https://www.mmamania.com/2019/10/19/20918683/ufc-boston-official-bonus-winners-weidman-reyes-hardy-rodriguez-stephens-espn-rosa-results-knockout)”-winning armbar finish of Manny Bermudez ([watch it](https://www.mmamania.com/2019/10/18/20918680/ufc-boston-full-fight-video-highlights-weidman-reyes-espn-results-rosa-verbal-submission-bermudez)).\n\nHe’ll give up one inch each of height and reach to “Thug Nasty.”\n\nRosa’s durability and tenacity are impressive, and tapping a Brazilian jiu-jitsu ace like Bermudez off of his back shows that his ground game is legitimate. Thing is, Mitchell overpowered Bobby Moffett two fights back, and I’d rate Moffett’s submission skills at around the same level as Rosa’s and his wrestling chops a level above. Mitchell will be the one dictating the fight, and I’m not convinced Rosa can finish him from a disadvantageous position.\n\n“Thug Nasty” isn’t as fearsome a puncher as Shane Burgos and will struggle to find a submission despite his edge in physicality, so Rosa will have 15 minutes to find a miracle. Unfortunately, that’s just not long enough. Mitchell’s strength and aggression keep things close on the feet while he takes over with takedowns and top control."
