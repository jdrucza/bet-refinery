  "body": "Your SugarHouse Promo Code is here.\n\nFor their sportsbook and their online casino.\n\nThe catch?\n\nIt’s only available when you’re in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.\n\nAlthough you can expect more and more states to be available soon.\n\n- - -\n\n## Win More\n\nThe secret to winning more as a sports bettor is to have multiple betting accounts. You can shop for the best odds and find a variety of promos that will help bump up your balance.\n\nAnd SugarHouse has some brilliant promos.\n\nFirst and foremost, they offer a $250 FREE BET.\n\nTo quote the President, that’s a yuuuuge head start.\n\nOn top of that, they have weekly deals in their [promo section](https://wlsugarhouseaffiliates.adsrv.eacdn.com/C.ashx?btag=a_3460b_23c_&affid=982&siteid=3460&adid=23&c=).\n\nLastly, they have a clever [VIP program](https://wlsugarhouseaffiliates.adsrv.eacdn.com/C.ashx?btag=a_3460b_23c_&affid=982&siteid=3460&adid=23&c=) to reward loyal customers from New Jersey.\n\n- - -\n\n### **Legal States**\n\n* SugarHouse New Jersey – Active\n* SugarHouse Pennsylvania – Active\n* Illinois - n/a\n* Michigan - n/a\n\n\n\nSugarHouse has a brother though. BetRivers.\n\nLike Philip Rivers, but more props:\n\n* BetRivers - Colorado\n* BetRivers– n/a\n\n- - -\n\n### **Download SugarHouse App:**\n\n* [iOS SugarHouse App Install](https://wlsugarhouseaffiliates.adsrv.eacdn.com/C.ashx?btag=a_2083b_37c_&affid=648&siteid=2083&adid=37&c=) – NJ, 21+\n* [Android SugarHouse App Install](https://wlsugarhouseaffiliates.adsrv.eacdn.com/C.ashx?btag=a_2083b_45c_&affid=648&siteid=2083&adid=45&c=) – NJ, 21+\n\n- - -\n\n### **In-Play Betting**\n\nThe live betting menu at SugarHouse NJ sportsbook is unbelievably deep and the largest in both the New Jersey markets. You can bet on a specific at-bat in a baseball game, or play a head-to-head wager on players or teams involved in that night’s games. Which team will hit the most home runs? Which pitcher will record the most strikeouts? The offers are equally in-depth for all the major sports.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Cash Out Your Bets Early**\n\nPlaySugarHouse offers the option of cashing out a bet while the bet is still “live”.\n\nThe live-ticket system allows you to cash out of a bet at a profit should the particular game shift in your favor, or they can hedge their bet if things aren’t going well for them that night.\n\nWhile this feature does sound great, it could work against you as cashing out too early may have cost you cash in the long term depending on the result of the event you wagered on.\n\n- - -\n\n## **iRush VIP Rewards Program**\n\nSugarHouse offers free membership into its loyalty rewards program and the 11 tiers of benefits it provides.\n\nThe iRush program is points-based, with points earned through a combination of real money wagered and the number of combinations for each sports wager.\n\nFor example, a $10 straight bet is worth one point. All points will remain in the account for 30 days, while the number of points you earn over a 60-day rolling period determines your tier level.\n\nIn as few as 40 points, you can take your new membership up to the second tier. From there, the ladder escalates, with 20,000 reward points needed to reach tier 10. Tier 11 is available by invitation only.\n\nYou can access the iRush bonus store even as a new first-tier player, which allows you to exchange points for bonus wagers.\n\nAs you move up, you can become eligible to get customized deposit assistance, birthday presents, free plays, exclusive invite-only dinners and multipliers on wagers.\n\n- - -\n\n# SugarHouse Deposit and Withdrawal\n\nThe variety of deposit options for Sugarhouse online sportsbook in New Jersey are much deeper than in Pennsylvania.

No extra bonus and promo offers on deposit methods are available at the moment, maybe in 2020.\n\n- - -\n\n### What to Play at SugarHouse NJ Casino Online?\n\nThe games available include at SugarHouse NJ Casino almost 2000 slots, 100 table games including blackjack and roulette, craps, 3-card poker, baccarat, and a poker room.
