Other books to cash out, but not to the extent of SugarHouse.\n\nThe live-ticket system allows you to cash out of a bet at a profit or to limit your losses, depending on what's happening. \n\nImagine you're on the Lakers and they're up 10 at the half but Anthony Davis isn't coming out from the locker room because of a soft tissue injury. Cash that ticket out. \n\nLast leg of a parlay not looking great early, cash out with the live-ticket system.\n\n# **[JOIN NOW](https://www.playsugarhouse.com/?btag=a_3460b_303c_&siteid=3460)**\n\n- - -\n\n## **iRush VIP Rewards Program**\n\nSugarHouse offers free membership into its loyalty rewards program which is pretty unique.
