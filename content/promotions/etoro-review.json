  "body": "We bet on sports, horses and even ... dogs.\n\nAnd we bet on the stock market and on crypto.\n\nThe latter is socially admired and not called betting.\n\nThe former evokes images of dirty OTBs in the US. Scummy places, reservced for society's lowest.\n\nAnd yet we farking love all of it. Applying similarly logic to every discipline. \n\nLook for an edge. Bet.\n\nAdmitedly, the difference being that you can absolutely do your balls at sports betting if you don't have an edge. The vig stacks against you, whereas, stock markets and crypto exchanges have only trended positively over time.\n\nAnyway, we digress.\n\nWe love betting on crypto and buying ETFs, so we thought we'd recommend one of the most popular trading platforms on the planet, eToro.\n\nIn the eToro review, we'll discuss the strengths, weaknesses and why we bet with them. We'll keep the format similar to our sportsbook review in terms of markets offered, UX experience and fees (odds).\n\nSo let's get it on.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Who Is eToro?**\n\nUnibet is a European monster, based out of Malta. \n\nThey operate in 100+ countries and are part of the Kindred Group, which you may or may not have heard of.\n\nThey also have their own online casino. Which you can probably access too, depending on your location.\n\n<iframe scrolling='no' frameBorder='0' style='padding:0px; margin:0px; border:0px;border-style:none;border-style:none;' width='230' height='150' src=\"https://wlkindred.adsrv.eacdn.com/I.ashx?btag=a_595b_304c_&affid=167&siteid=595&adid=304&c=\" ></iframe>\n\n- - -\n\n## **eToro Review**\n\nHere is our executive summary of the eToro Review:\n\n![etoro review](/images/uploads/3.png \"etoro review\")\n\n- - -\n\n## **Join eToro Now**\n\n<div class=\"predictIt\">\n\n<a href=\"https://www.etoro.com/discover/markets/cryptocurrencies?sort=InstrumentID&utm_medium=Affiliate&utm_source=100160&utm_content=15680&utm_serial=&utm_campaign=&utm_term=\">**Start Buying BTC Today!</a>**\n\n</div>\n\n- - -\n\n## **Total Number of Markets**\n\n## **Crypto**\n\n\n\n\n\n- - -\n\n## **Stocks**\n\n\n\n- - -\n\n## **eToro Fees**\n\n\n\n- - -\n\n## **App, UX & Design**\n\n\n\n- - -\n\n## **eToro Conclusion**\n\n\n\n\n\n- - -\n\n## **Join eToro Now**\n\n<div class=\"predictIt\">\n\n<a href=\"https://www.etoro.com/discover/markets/cryptocurrencies?sort=InstrumentID&utm_medium=Affiliate&utm_source=100160&utm_content=15680&utm_serial=&utm_campaign=&utm_term=\">**Start Buying BTC Today!</a>**\n\n</div>\n\n- - -\n\n## **Banking Options**\n\nWe know depositing and withdrawing can be a pain in the eggs.
