  "body": "We bet on sports, horses and even ... dogs.\n\nAnd we bet on the stock market and on crypto.\n\nThe latter is socially admired and not called betting.\n\nThe former evokes images of dirty OTBs in the US. Scummy places, reservced for society's lowest.\n\nAnd yet we farking love all of it. Applying similarly logic to every discipline. \n\nLook for an edge. Bet.\n\nAdmitedly, the difference being that you can absolutely do your balls at sports betting if you don't have an edge. The vig stacks against you, whereas, stock markets and crypto exchanges have only trended positively over time.\n\nAnyway, we digress.\n\nWe love betting on crypto and buying ETFs, so we thought we'd recommend one of the most popular trading platforms on the planet, eToro.\n\nIn the eToro review, we'll discuss the strengths, weaknesses and why we bet with them. We'll keep the format similar to our sportsbook review in terms of markets offered, UX experience and fees (odds).\n\nSo let's get it on.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Who Is eToro?**\n\nFounded in 2007 and based in Israel, eToro has millions of clients in over 140 countries.\n\nThey're a big player. \n\nWhy I signed up with them is because I can buy cryptos and ETFs in the same place.\n\nPlus the Alec Baldwin marketing is genius brand awareness.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_SEGWJbxToE\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nThe \"Trade like a Steve\" campaign was also genius. Showing off the **[copy trading](https://med.etoro.com/B12885_A100160_TClick.aspx)** functionality. \n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cMavJiCdS4E\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nBig miss using two white dudes though. Such an easy birdie to make it more powerful and they missed the PC win.\n\nNevertheless, some clever marketing and dual functionality (crypto / stocks) has propelled their brand to the absolute stratoshpere.\n\n- - -\n\n## **eToro Review**\n\nHere is our executive summary of the eToro Review:\n\n![etoro review](/images/uploads/review-imagery.png \"etoro review\")\n\n- - -\n\n## **Join eToro Now**\n\n<div class=\"predictIt\">\n\n<a href=\"https://www.etoro.com/discover/markets/cryptocurrencies?sort=InstrumentID&utm_medium=Affiliate&utm_source=100160&utm_content=15680&utm_serial=&utm_campaign=&utm_term=\">**Start Buying BTC Today!</a>**\n\n</div>\n\n- - -\n\n## **eToro Fees**\n\nThe best insight can be found **[here](https://www.etoro.com/trading/fees/)**.\n\nBut the summary is, it's zero commission on stocks. 0%. No flat fees.\n\nWithdrawal charges are $5. \n\nBut if you buy crypto, you're subject to the spreads. Which are common in the new industry.\n\nBitcoin is 0.75%, Etherium 1.90%, and you'll pay up to 4.5% for some really random Alt Coins. \n\n- - -\n\n## **App, UX & Design**\n\nNot sure how to put this in to words but the UX is good.\n\nIt's functional, its easy to navigate.\n\nBut it's not a 10 from a design perspective. Just feels a little immature and lacking polish. Like the font style and font size is just too big and simple.\n\nBut I'm being picky. You can get to where you need to and it's largely intuitive. \n\n- - -\n\n## **eToro Conclusion**\n\n0% commission and the flexibility to buy ETFs and crypto in the same place is unreal. And globally rare (at the moment).\n\nThe copy trading functionality is cool too, and brings an extra feature that adds value. It's perfect for rookies.\n\nIn terms of getting started in the game, there are few better places. \n\nAnd that's why we hit eToro up about recommending their website. \n\n## **So Join eToro Now**\n\n<div class=\"predictIt\">\n\n<a href=\"https://www.etoro.com/discover/markets/cryptocurrencies?sort=InstrumentID&utm_medium=Affiliate&utm_source=100160&utm_content=15680&utm_serial=&utm_campaign=&utm_term=\">**And Start Buying More BTC!</a>**\n\n</div>",
