Which you can probably access too, depending on your location.\n\n- - -\n\n## **Unibet Sportsbook (AKA 888 Sport)**\n\nYou’ll notice their site is incredibly similar to **888 Sport**. \n\nBoth are managed by the Swedish sportsbook provider, **Kambi**. So the markets are presumably loaded and managed in Europe. \n\nThat's not ideal but we’ve got a soft spot for Unibet because of their range of golf markets. And really, they have a deep range of almost everything.\n\nBecause of that Europeanism, the criticism is they can be a little trigger happy when it comes to limiting your account. And sometimes their innovative markets, like player props, carry a little more juice than we’d like.\n\nHowever, we love their **sign up offers** and **weekly promos**. \n\nThere’s some good stuff to give your account an edge. Plus the odds on UFC and some of the secondary sporting markets are 104%. Which is super competitive and great for customers.\n\n- - -\n\n## **UX & Design**\n\nThe user nav on desktop and the app isn’t perfect but the branding is decent and the overall experience is strong enough.\n\nUnibet Score & Final Comments\n\n- - -\n\n## **Why Bet With Unibet?**\n\n<div class=\"predictIt\">\n\n**<a href=\"https://nj.unibet.com/p/big-game-new-player-special/exclusive/?utm_source=affiliate&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=affiliate&btag=a_595b_326c_\" target=\"_blank\">JOIN POINTSBET NOW</a>**\n\n</div>\n\n- - -\n\n## **Legal States**\n\nCurrently, Unibet are live for cell phone betting in:\n\n* New Jersey\n* Indiana\n* Colorado\n\n- - -\n\n## **Banking Options**\n\nWe know depositing and withdrawing can be a pain in the eggs.
