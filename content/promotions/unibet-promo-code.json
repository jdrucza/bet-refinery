Which you can probably access too, depending on your location.\n\n<iframe scrolling='no' frameBorder='0' style='padding:0px; margin:0px; border:0px;border-style:none;border-style:none;' width='460' height='300' src=\"https://wlkindred.adsrv.eacdn.com/I.ashx?btag=a_595b_304c_&affid=167&siteid=595&adid=304&c=\" ></iframe>\n\n- - -\n\n## **Unibet Review**\n\nHere is our executive summary of the Unibet Review. Pretty self explanatory my friend but we'll deep dive into each pocket as well.\n\n![UNIBET PROMO CODE & UNIBET REVIEW](/images/uploads/3.png \"UNIBET PROMO CODE & UNIBET REVIEW\")\n\n- - -\n\n## **Odds**\n\n- - -\n\n## **Promotions**\n\n- - -\n\n## **Total Number of Markets**\n\n- - -\n\n## **Customer Experience**\n\nWith this section, we're referring to:\n\n* how long does it take to get your bet placed if it's referred to a trader\n* how accepting are they of winners\n* how long to get your cash out\n* how friendly are they on the phone, in person or on socials\n\nNow, as you can imagine, this category is pretty subjective.\n\nThere's definitely going to be a sportsbook that you hate because of one or two poisonous experiences. And yet, we've found them great.\n\nAnd vice versa.\n\nBut over the course of many years, this part of the review should have a nice wisdom of the crowd effect and we'll evolve the numbers as we hear or experience good and bad things.\n\nWith that said, Unibet is just ok here.\n\nThey can take awhile to accept referred bets. That's what happens when your traders are in Europe. Not a great experience. However, they let our bets on for bigger amounts than some of the other operators.\n\nOur staff run ins have been very pleasant but we've had to wait awhile to withdraw cash before.\n\nSo you can see, it's a bit hit and miss. And it probably won't improve until the Unibet brand is running by itself on US soil, and we can't see that happen for many years.\n\nSo it's not a shocker. We get some hot bets on. But it can be painful too.\n\n- - -\n\n## **App, UX & Design**\n\nSimilar to bet365, the UX across desktop and mobile app is just ok. It's not pretty but it's functional. \n\nYou can find where you're going, which could be worse with so many markets, but they won't be winning design awards. And that's fine.\n\nThe app is a mirror image of the desktop site, probably slightly prettier in its symmetry. \n\nBranding is where they really need to get humming, and that's the challenge for most the operators in the US sportsbook market. How do you stand out in this billion dollar industry?\n\nWell they started with some tv/YouTube ads, so let's see if they can build on the localised efforts.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eViKwZOoca4\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n- - -\n\n## **Unibet Conclusion**\n\nYou’ll notice their site is incredibly similar to **888 Sport**. \n\nBoth are managed by the Swedish sportsbook provider, **Kambi**. So the markets are presumably loaded and managed in Europe. \n\nThat's not ideal but we’ve got a soft spot for Unibet because of their range of golf markets. And really, they have a deep range of almost everything.\n\nBecause of that Europeanism, the criticism is they can be a little trigger happy when it comes to limiting your account. And sometimes their innovative markets, like player props, carry a little more juice than we’d like.\n\nHowever, we love their **sign up offers** and **weekly promos**. \n\nThere’s some good stuff to give your account an edge. Plus the odds on UFC and some of the secondary sporting markets are 104%. Which is super competitive and great for customers.\n\n- - -\n\n\\##Unibet Promo Code##\n\n<iframe scrolling='no' frameBorder='0' style='padding:0px; margin:0px; border:0px;border-style:none;border-style:none;' width='728' height='90' src=\"https://wlkindred.adsrv.eacdn.com/I.ashx?btag=a_595b_313c_&affid=167&siteid=595&adid=313&c=\" ></iframe>\n\n- - -\n\n## **Why Bet With Unibet?**\n\n<div class=\"predictIt\">\n\n**<a href=\"https://nj.unibet.com/p/big-game-new-player-special/exclusive/?utm_source=affiliate&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=affiliate&btag=a_595b_326c_\" target=\"_blank\">JOIN POINTSBET NOW</a>**\n\n</div>\n\n- - -\n\n## **Legal States**\n\nCurrently, Unibet are live for cell phone betting in:\n\n* New Jersey\n* Indiana\n* Colorado\n\n- - -\n\n## **Banking Options**\n\nWe know depositing and withdrawing can be a pain in the eggs.
