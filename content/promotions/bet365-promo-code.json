  "body": "Bet365 is the world's biggest sportsbook.\n\nTheir model is simple:\n\nWe bet on f'n everything and we bet aggressive prices.\n\nSeriously, look up second division Russian women's weightlifting. They'll bet on it, they'll have the best odds, and they'll probably have live vision of it. With Putin in the crowd choosing his next bodyguard to juice up. \n\nBet365's live sport vision is no joke too.\n\nThat's the summary of why you want to bet there:\n\n1. Great Odds\n2. Bet On Everything\n3. Brilliant Live Sport Streams\n\n- - -\n\n## **Who Is Bet365?**\n\nThe British company are the world's biggest bookie, operating in every pocket of the world.\n\nThey make more money than the Queen.\n\nSeriously. Google Denise Coates, or just read her **[Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denise_Coates)**. \n\nShe's a farking baller. \n\nYou think Oprah makes bank? Denise can buy her and still have $7B leftover.\n\n- - -\n\n## **bet365's Strengths**\n\nBeyond their strengths:\n\n1. great odds,\n2. lots of markets, and\n3. live vision;\n\nthey have a couple other features we love.\n\nFirstly, they're independent.\n\nIf you've been around the game as long as us, you'd know that a lot of operators have the same offering.\n\nSome sportsbooks are built with the same infrastructure and the only difference between companies is marketing. \n\nMany companies automatically scrape their competitors' odds and sit in between. It's a real cat way to operate. Efficient for operators but the customer is losing.\n\nBet365 often set the market. They price sporting events like old school guys in Vegas. \n\nWe respect that. It's why they \"go up\" first on markets and often have different pricing.\n\n- - -\n\n## **bet365's Weaknesses**\n\nNo one is perfect. Even a juggernaut with decades of experience.\n\nThe weaknesses include:\n\n* Limited bonus codes to open an account\n* Their UX, on the website and app, is pretty weak\n* Like any operator, they'll slow your action if you're winning\n\nAll in all, you weigh up those negatives with the positives and you can see why they are the world's biggest sportsbook.\n\n- - -\n\n## **bet365 App**\n\nThe app isn't market leading either. Just the UX isn't pretty. But it's damn functional.",
